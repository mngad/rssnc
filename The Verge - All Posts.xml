            <Title>Pokémon Go will now record your steps in the background</Title>

Developer Niantic has &lt;a href=&quot;https://nianticlabs.com/blog/adventuresync/&quot;&gt;just added&lt;/a&gt; a new feature called “adventure sync,” which records your steps in the background. Previously, one of the biggest annoyances with &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;was that your walking data — which is especially important for hatching eggs — was only tracked when your phone was awake. Today’s update should alleviate that for players who have stuck with the game. The feature will also sync in the background with HealthKit on iOS and Android’s Google Fit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;DZSHoo&quot;&gt;Late last year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/2/16725884/ingress-prime-update-niantic-pokemon-go&quot;&gt;Niantic revealed that it was moving all of its location-based AR games&lt;/a&gt; — which include &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ingress,&lt;/em&gt; and an upcoming &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; game — to the same platform...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18023046/pokemon-go-adventure-sync&quot;&gt;Continue reading&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</Description>

            <Title>Apple News hits 90 million readers as rumored subscription service nears</Title>
            <Description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lOUbk8UAuuHu8ov1_DeDj03F004=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61906183/jbareham_160909_1215_B_0165.0.0.jpg&quot; /&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;pqDkRV&quot;&gt;Apple News has reached 90 million regular readers, three years after the app launched on iPhones and iPads. The stat comes out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/apple-news-humans-algorithms.html&quot;&gt;a story this morning in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which got to go behind the scenes with the Apple News team to see how it works. The &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;also furthers reports that Apple is close to launching a subscription service inside the app.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;MuvEj4&quot;&gt;There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/17/17246332/apple-news-subscription-service-rumors&quot;&gt;already rumors&lt;/a&gt; that Apple plans to turn its News app into a bigger venture, and the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;backs those up. Its story says that Apple plans to “bundle access to dozens of magazines” for a monthly fee, much like Netflix does for TV shows and movies. Newspapers could be included in the bundle, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;C5Qk8R&quot;&gt;That wouldn’t be a huge surprise. Apple bought a service called Texture earlier...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18022980/apple-news-90-million-readers-subscription-service-rumor&quot;&gt;Continue reading&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</Description>

The company was acquired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dealcentral.com/&quot;&gt;DealCentral&lt;/a&gt;, a startup specializing in deal hunting and coupons, earlier this month. According to DealCentral CEO Yishai Grossman, the relaunch is strategically timed before Black Friday and the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;5w02iJ&quot;&gt;The new site brings staff and user reviews of products, along with deals on laptops, televisions, and other tech products. Grossman says he’s hired an editorial team with “decades of combined experience in the deal space,” including Slickdeals, eBates, and FatWallet. “Acquiring CompUSA makes sense for us on so many levels,” Grossman said in a press release. “Out of the gate we can offer the best deals, sales and coupons from all around the web...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18022674/compusa-dealcentral-affiliate-deals-black-friday&quot;&gt;Continue reading&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</Description>

Developer Niantic &lt;a href=&quot;https://nianticlabs.com/blog/adventuresync/&quot;&gt;is adding&lt;/a&gt; a new feature called “adventure sync,” which records your steps in the background. It’s rolling out to all users “soon.” Previously, one of the biggest annoyances with &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;was that your walking data — which is especially important for hatching eggs — was only tracked when your phone was awake. Today’s update should alleviate that for players who have stuck with the game. The feature will also sync in the background with HealthKit on iOS and Android’s Google Fit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;DZSHoo&quot;&gt;Late last year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/2/16725884/ingress-prime-update-niantic-pokemon-go&quot;&gt;Niantic revealed that it was moving all of its location-based AR games&lt;/a&gt; — which include &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ingress,&lt;/em&gt; and an upcoming &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; game...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18023046/pokemon-go-adventure-sync&quot;&gt;Continue reading&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</Description>

That service will launch on November 27th, and it will cost $5.99 a month, or $64.99 per year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;RSc8nI&quot;&gt;Fox News will begin selling subscriptions on October 28th, and it will air a special preview for the platform that same night at 8PM ET.
