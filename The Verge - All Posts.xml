            <Title>The OnePlus 6T won’t have a headphone jack, but it may have a bigger battery</Title>

The company wants to deliver an optimal set of features, and Pei thinks that it’s worth removing the 3.5mm audio jack in favor of something better: battery life. “By removing the jack we’ve freed up more space, allowing us to...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/13/17854826/oneplus-6t-battery-android-headphone-jack&quot;&gt;Continue reading&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</Description>

            <Title>Netflix’s Hold the Dark throws Jeffrey Wright to the wolves</Title>

This review comes from the Toronto International Film Festival.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;YIQjn8&quot;&gt;Director Jeremy Saulnier specializes in dragging his characters out of their worlds and leaving them out of their depths. Over the course of his three previous films — &lt;em&gt;Murder Party&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Blue Ruin&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/13/11419098/green-room-movie-review-patrick-stewart&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Green Room&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — he’s developed a reputation for intense stories punctuated with startling violence, but none of the intensity would be possible and none of the violence would be meaningful if he weren’t so focused on stories about people who are ill-equipped to handle either. In &lt;em&gt;Murder Party&lt;/em&gt;, a lonely man follows up on a Halloween party invitation and discovers...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/13/17854354/hold-the-dark-review-netflix-jeremy-saulnier-jeffrey-wright-alexander-skarsgard&quot;&gt;Continue reading&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</Description>

            <Title>Polar’s new fitness watch will measure the wattage of your exercise</Title>

Let’s start with the bigger, more expensive watch. The Vantage V costs $499.90 and includes a new optical heart rate sensor with nine LEDs along two different wavelengths (green and red). This, the company says, should make its heart rate readings more accurate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;aJVrSB&quot;&gt;The biggest addition to the watch is its power measurements for running. This is a relatively new metric, but you might recognize it because of products like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stryd.com/&quot;&gt;Stryd&lt;/a&gt;. It essentially measures a wearer’s work output, similar to how cyclists measure their watts generated. Runners likely will appreciate this for training purposes. It doesn’t support LTE, although it does...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/13/17854730/polar-fitness-watch-vantage-m-v-launch-buy&quot;&gt;Continue reading&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</Description>

            <Title>Ring’s Video Doorbell 2 is discounted to $110 on Amazon</Title>

Normally $199, this wire-free video doorbell is currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2CRWSTE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a bargain at $110&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;x0ynxH&quot;&gt;The company still sells its original model for $99, but opting for its successor for $10 more is smart. It gets you full HD video resolution, swappable faceplates (silver and black are included), and a battery that’s easy to pop out for recharging, though you won’t have to worry about this if you choose to hardwire the doorbell at installation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;0WJ808&quot;&gt;This is one of the simplest home security implementations to install, and today’s deal beats Amazon’s Prime Day discounts for the Ring Video Doorbell 2. It makes buying into Ring’s...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2018/9/13/17854644/ring-video-doorbell-amazon-deal&quot;&gt;Continue reading&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</Description>

            <Title>LG’s five-camera V40 will be announced on October 3rd</Title>
            <Description>&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VbToDNWuX38xz4CossrintBsEcU=/0x113:472x428/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61382489/LGV40.0.png&quot; /&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;NMZEw2&quot;&gt;LG announced today that it will hold an event on October 3rd to introduce the V40 ThinQ, its next flagship phone and, remarkably, LG’s fourth flagship this year. The event invitation is adorned with the phrase “take five,” which is a little depressing as a product tagline. (It reads a little like, “it took five tries to nail this.”) But it actually seems to be teasing a new feature: the phone is expected to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/26/17506434/lg-v40-phone-five-cameras-report-rumor&quot;&gt;include a total of five cameras&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;h7U5NE&quot;&gt;If that happens, the V40 might be the first smartphone to include five cameras — presumably, that’d be two on the front and three on the back. While that combination would be new, those setups aren’t unprecedented. Huawei included a triple-camera system &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/6/17198708/huawei-p20-pro-review&quot;&gt;on the P20 Pro&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, and several...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/13/17854372/lg-v40-five-cameras-announcement-date&quot;&gt;Continue reading&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</Description>

            <Title>The Moto Z keyboard Mod has been canceled</Title>

The mod’s creators chalk its demise up to supply chain issues, a lack of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17682060/motorola-moto-z3-phone-review-specs-price&quot;&gt;Moto Z&lt;/a&gt; phone owners, and zero retailer interest. That combination does sound pretty damning. However, Livermorium says it’s now focusing its efforts on an actual phone, called the “Q-device,” which will be a “high-end and premium landscape slider phone.” People who backed the keyboard mod on Indiegogo can automatically roll their pledge over to this new phone and then buy it at a discounted rate. (But I don’t know why you’d put faith in this company a second time.)

For one, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17824594/apple-iphone-x-6s-se-discontinued-2018-event&quot;&gt;iPhone X is gone entirely&lt;/a&gt;, as are older iPhone models with headphone jacks. In its place is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847036/apple-iphone-xs-hands-on-features-photos-video-camera-2018&quot;&gt;new iPhone XS&lt;/a&gt;, a slightly superior version of the bezel-less smartphone Apple first released for $999 last year. And now, there’s an even larger version — the iPhone XS Max — that has an eye-popping 6.5-inch display, which is Apple’s largest ever. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;iXMptP&quot;&gt;Complicating the conversation is the third phone that was announced yesterday: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17851768/apple-iphone-xr-specs-impressions-features&quot;&gt;iPhone XR&lt;/a&gt;.
