            <Title>Rick and Morty’s head writer is making an animated Star Trek series</Title>

At the time, it was reported that those shows would include a soapier Starfleet Academy show from the creators of &lt;em&gt;Gossip Girl&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16879936/marvel-runaways-finale-season-2&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Runaways&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; two limited series, including one based on &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wrath of Khan&lt;/em&gt;; and an animated series. Today, the studio announced more details on that animated project: it’ll be an adult cartoon called &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Lower Decks&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;created by &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt; head writer Mike McMahan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;00TytQ&quot;&gt;Described as focusing on “the support crew serving on one of Starfleet’s least important ships,” the new...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18023124/star-trek-lower-decks-animated-series-rick-morty-mike-mcmahan&quot;&gt;Continue reading&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</Description>

            <Title>Christie’s sells its first AI portrait for $432,500, beating estimates of $10,000</Title>

The sale is unusual not only as a first for the 252-year-old auction house, but because the expected price for the print was between $7,000 and $10,000.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;KuY8Jt&quot;&gt;The artwork was created by a collective named Obvious. The three members of Obvious, a trio of 25-year-old French students, used a type of machine learning algorithm known as a GAN (generative adversarial network) to create the picture. The network was trained on a dataset of historical portraits, and then it tried to create one of its own. Obvious printed the image, framed it, and signed it with part of the GAN’s algorithm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside id=&quot;iDXWTD&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component=&quot;readmore&quot; data-anthem-component-data=&apos;{&quot;stories&quot;:[{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;How three French students used borrowed code to put the first AI portrait in Christie’s &quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18013190/ai-art-portrait-auction-christies-belamy-obvious-robbie-barrat-gans&quot;}]}&apos;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;51qSZE&quot;&gt;However, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18013190/ai-art-portrait-auction-christies-belamy-obvious-robbie-barrat-gans&quot;&gt;reported earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;B...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18023266/ai-art-portrait-christies-obvious-sold&quot;&gt;Continue reading&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</Description>

As of Thursday morning, at least 10 bombs have been discovered, including packages sent to George Soros, Robert De Niro, and Joe Biden. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;cTwAry&quot;&gt;While the CNN delivery made its way to parent company Time Warner in New York, triggering a massive law enforcement response, packages meant for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were never delivered. Moreover, the packages have been obtained intact, giving investigators a wealth of potential clues. Law enforcement will now sift through all of the evidence in the hunt for the culprit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;r4PX36&quot;&gt;Crucially, the intercepted packages were obtained by authorities before detonation.

            <Title>Fortnite’s SCAR will make its Nerf debut next summer</Title>

Next summer, the SCAR will make its Nerf debut as the “AR-L Blaster,” the first Nerf gun to come out of the partnership between Epic Games and Hasbro.

That service will launch on November 27th, and it will cost $5.99 a month, or $64.99 per year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;RSc8nI&quot;&gt;Fox News will begin selling subscriptions on October 28th, and it will air a special preview for the platform that same night at 8PM ET. Fox noted in September that it plans to launch the platform prior to the midterm elections — it does seem designed for the exact purpose of whipping up the Republican Party’s base — but that doesn’t appear to have worked out, although it will certainly be up and running for the upcoming 2020 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;&lt;aside id=&quot;jznYCb&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;The...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18022964/fox-nation-news-streaming-service-launch-date-november-27th&quot;&gt;Continue reading&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</Description>

            <Title>Pokémon Go will soon record your steps in the background</Title>

Developer Niantic &lt;a href=&quot;https://nianticlabs.com/blog/adventuresync/&quot;&gt;is adding&lt;/a&gt; a new feature called “adventure sync,” which records your steps in the background. It’s rolling out to all users “soon.” Previously, one of the biggest annoyances with &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;was that your walking data — which is especially important for hatching eggs — was only tracked when your phone was awake. Today’s update should alleviate that for players who have stuck with the game. The feature will also sync in the background with HealthKit on iOS and Android’s Google Fit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;DZSHoo&quot;&gt;Late last year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/2/16725884/ingress-prime-update-niantic-pokemon-go&quot;&gt;Niantic revealed that it was moving all of its location-based AR games&lt;/a&gt; — which include &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ingress,&lt;/em&gt; and an upcoming &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; game...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18023046/pokemon-go-adventure-sync&quot;&gt;Continue reading&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</Description>

The stat comes out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/apple-news-humans-algorithms.html&quot;&gt;a story this morning in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which got to go behind the scenes with the Apple News team to see how it works. The &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;also furthers reports that Apple is close to launching a subscription service inside the app.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;MuvEj4&quot;&gt;There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/17/17246332/apple-news-subscription-service-rumors&quot;&gt;already rumors&lt;/a&gt; that Apple plans to turn its News app into a bigger venture, and the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;backs those up. Its story says that Apple plans to “bundle access to dozens of magazines” for a monthly fee, much like Netflix does for TV shows and movies. Newspapers could be included in the bundle, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;C5Qk8R&quot;&gt;That wouldn’t be a huge surprise. Apple bought a service called Texture earlier...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18022980/apple-news-90-million-readers-subscription-service-rumor&quot;&gt;Continue reading&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</Description>
