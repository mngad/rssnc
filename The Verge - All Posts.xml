            <Title>This smart power strip lets you individually control each outlet</Title>

So to address bigger needs, Kasa is introducing an entire smart power strip that allows you to individually control all six of its power sockets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;8hTYj5&quot;&gt;The Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Power Strip has six power sockets, which can be controlled through an app or by voice assistants, as well as three USB ports that always remain powered on. Kasa, which comes from the router company TP-Link, is far from the first to make a smart power strip, but it is perhaps the first major brand to do so. And given that, when it comes to power strips, you really want to buy from a legitimate brand, that makes this announcement a...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/13/17847244/tplink-kasa-smart-power-strip-control-sockets&quot;&gt;Continue reading&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</Description>

The Bullets v2 were priced at $19.99, and OnePlus promises to keep the price unchanged with its new USB-C edition, while adding a few design and feature updates. The Type-C Bullets will come with a built-in Cirrus Logic DAC, which should make them compatible with most USB-C devices, including laptops and tablets.

Firstly, the three-year-old iPhone 6S and two-year-old iPhone SE models are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17824594/apple-iphone-x-6s-se-discontinued-2018-event&quot;&gt;being discontinued&lt;/a&gt;, which is significant because they were the last remaining iPhones with headphone jacks that Apple was selling. Secondly and relatedly, the Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter that Apple used to ship in the box with its iPhones is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17827970/no-more-free-iphone-dongles&quot;&gt;now gone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;8jstG2&quot;&gt;Whether you’re buying an iPhone XS, XR, 8, or 7, from today you will no longer have a direct way to connect your wired headphones to your shiny new device.

Apple’s SVP of product marketing Phil Schiller played the same role he always does at each iPhone announcement, breaking down the camera technology in depth and explaining the improvements. This year he went as far as to pronounce that the iPhone XS will hail “a new era of photography.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;ba9EEy&quot;&gt;But the days where Apple held a major lead over every Android manufacturer are long gone. Google’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/18/13315168/google-pixel-camera-software-marc-levoy&quot;&gt;innovative approach to computational photography&lt;/a&gt; with the Pixel line means they’re now the phones to beat in terms of pure image quality, while competitors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/13/17099184/galaxy-s9-pixel-2-camera-photo-comparison&quot;&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S9 Plus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/6/17198708/huawei-p20-pro-review&quot;&gt;Huawei’s P20 Pro&lt;/a&gt; have strong claims to supremacy in areas like low-light performance....&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/13/17853984/iphone-xs-camera-vs-google-pixel&quot;&gt;Continue reading&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</Description>

In January, a former security engineer said he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882270/google-diversity-hiring-executives-cory-altheide?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;had been stopped from sharing his pro-diversity views&lt;/a&gt;. This summer, a group of employees successfully pressured the company to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/1/17418406/google-maven-drone-imagery-ai-contract-expire?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;stop building an AI project for the military&lt;/a&gt;.

            <Title>Apple reveals new prices for iPhone battery replacements that go into effect January 1st</Title>

In the meeting, a series of Google executives acknowledges the disappointment and fears of many of their employees in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s election as president, while also acknowledging that the process was fair and that Google employees have a wide range of political opinions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;UavuTD&quot;&gt;“Most people here are pretty upset and pretty sad,” Google cofounder Sergey Brin says as the meeting begins. “I find this election deeply offensive, and I know many of you do too.

(Of course, the Series 2 added GPS and water resistance, so it’s hard to fault Apple for adding 0.9mm of thickness to the overall case.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;e-image&quot;&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;qUjKOL&quot;&gt;The dimensions get even more intriguing when you start to consider the footprint of the newest Apple Watch.

One of the biggest upgrades is the switch to Apple’s new A12 Bionic processor, which is said to be 15 percent faster than the A11. It’s also notable that these features are now available in the form of a 6.5-inch XS Max, which is the largest iPhone ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;r4B7KD&quot;&gt;One of the highlighted demonstrations onstage today was the ability to manually adjust the depth of field after taking photos in Portrait Mode.
