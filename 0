    <title>Rick and Morty’s head writer is making an animated Star Trek series</title>

At the time, it was reported that those shows would include a soapier Starfleet Academy show from the creators of &lt;em&gt;Gossip Girl&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16879936/marvel-runaways-finale-season-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Runaways&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; two limited series, including one based on &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wrath of Khan&lt;/em&gt;; and an animated series. Today, the studio announced more details on that animated project: it’ll be an adult cartoon called &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Lower Decks&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;created by &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt; head writer Mike McMahan.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Christie’s sells its first AI portrait for $432,500, beating estimates of $10,000</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZnrBh-3Urp6TT4VxeE0DImYspfU=/0x1:1200x801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61907021/image_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="X22O2M"&gt;Christie’s has &lt;a href="https://www.christies.com/Lotfinder/lot_details.aspx?hdnSaleID=27814&amp;amp;LN=363&amp;amp;intsaleid=27814&amp;amp;sid=41bfe836-b0c1-4afa-9298-09cc909345ee"&gt;sold&lt;/a&gt; its first piece of AI art, a canvas named the &lt;em&gt;Portrait of Edmond Belamy&lt;/em&gt;, for $432,500. The sale is unusual not only as a first for the 252-year-old auction house, but because the expected price for the print was between $7,000 and $10,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuY8Jt"&gt;The artwork was created by a collective named Obvious. The three members of Obvious, a trio of 25-year-old French students, used a type of machine learning algorithm known as a GAN (generative adversarial network) to create the picture. The network was trained on a dataset of historical portraits, and then it tried to create one of its own. Obvious printed the image, framed it, and signed it with part of the GAN’s algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Western Digital’s new 15TB hard drive is the biggest one ever made</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DffAR5ZzHhk1oV6vOuRvj4EIdFs=/0x28:748x527/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61906665/Western_Digital_15TB_HDD.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="JBxVvL"&gt;Step aside, boring 14TB hard drives. There’s a new storage champion in town: Western Digital has announced a new 15TB Ultrastar DC HC620 HDD that takes the crown as the biggest hard drive yet, &lt;a href="https://www.slashgear.com/western-digital-hard-drive-lineup-gains-a-15tb-behemoth-25551384/"&gt;via&lt;em&gt; SlashGear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNdNa1"&gt;The new drive beats out Western Digital’s 14TB model &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/5/16432568/western-digital-14tb-hard-drive-ultrastar-hs14"&gt;that it announced last year&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.seagate.com/about-seagate/news/seagate-industry-advanced-14tb-data-storage-pr-master/"&gt;Seagate’s recently announced 14TB lineup&lt;/a&gt;. Seagate did announce last year that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/27/14417316/seagate-16tb-hard-drive-announced-coming-2018"&gt;planning to release a 16TB drive in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, which would have topped the old 14TB drives as well as the new 15TB Ultrastar, but there hasn’t been any word on the 16TB drive since that initial announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhJasr"&gt;That leaves the new Western Digital drive as the biggest hard drive available, although the company hasn’t said how much it’ll cost (spoiler: a lot) or when you’ll...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How authorities look for a mail bomber</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="jqgwaY"&gt;Panic unfolded yesterday after a series of pipe bombs were mailed to CNN and prominent critics of Trump. As of Thursday morning, at least 10 bombs have been discovered, including packages sent to George Soros, Robert De Niro, and Joe Biden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTwAry"&gt;While the CNN delivery made its way to parent company Time Warner in New York, triggering a massive law enforcement response, packages meant for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were never delivered. Moreover, the packages have been obtained intact, giving investigators a wealth of potential clues. Law enforcement will now sift through all of the evidence in the hunt for the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4PX36"&gt;Crucially, the intercepted packages were obtained by authorities before detonation. In a statement on the incident,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s SCAR will make its Nerf debut next summer</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kFsNVFikDC17AcMhTBgFRIva68Y=/0x488:2400x2088/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61906573/arl_blaster.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="qnaNmF"&gt;Last September, the FN SCAR made its virtual debut in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s popular battle royale mode as the legendary variant of the common assault rifle. Next summer, the SCAR will make its Nerf debut as the “AR-L Blaster,” the first Nerf gun to come out of the partnership between Epic Games and Hasbro. (&lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/06/fortnite-nerf-blasters-are-coming-in-2019"&gt;Look out for a whole line of them in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjfrF8"&gt;The toy version of the gas-operated self-loading rifle will appear on shelves on June 1st, 2019, and it will cost $49.99, &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/25/fortnites-first-real-life-nerf-blaster-announced"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The AR-L Blaster features “rapid-fire motorized blasting and flip-up sights,” presumably to help players hit each other more easily with foam darts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLPUlu"&gt;The Nerf gun is modeled from Fortnite’s assault rifle, which happens to look a lot like its real-life metal cousin: the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fox News’ streaming service will launch on November 27th </title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p0R8yU2fEh4olEnHwkwmmqxzDPY=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61906499/486121240.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="t6uRIc"&gt;Earlier this year, Fox News announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/20/17032526/fox-news-streaming-video-service-fox-nation-announced"&gt;launch a subscription-based streaming service&lt;/a&gt; called Fox Nation, an opinion platform featuring the network’s personalities and original content. That service will launch on November 27th, and it will cost $5.99 a month, or $64.99 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSc8nI"&gt;Fox News will begin selling subscriptions on October 28th, and it will air a special preview for the platform that same night at 8PM ET. Fox noted in September that it plans to launch the platform prior to the midterm elections — it does seem designed for the exact purpose of whipping up the Republican Party’s base — but that doesn’t appear to have worked out, although it will certainly be up and running for the upcoming 2020 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Go will soon record your steps in the background</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ik4AsjlmY9g0IkXkYVccIgKFBQ4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61906377/jbareham_160711_1134_0057_02.0.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="uTaROI"&gt;Soon you’ll be able to get a lot more out of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; without taking your phone out. Developer Niantic &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/adventuresync/"&gt;is adding&lt;/a&gt; a new feature called “adventure sync,” which records your steps in the background. It’s rolling out to all users “soon.” Previously, one of the biggest annoyances with &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;was that your walking data — which is especially important for hatching eggs — was only tracked when your phone was awake. Today’s update should alleviate that for players who have stuck with the game. The feature will also sync in the background with HealthKit on iOS and Android’s Google Fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZSHoo"&gt;Late last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/2/16725884/ingress-prime-update-niantic-pokemon-go"&gt;Niantic revealed that it was moving all of its location-based AR games&lt;/a&gt; — which include &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ingress,&lt;/em&gt; and an upcoming &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; game...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple News hits 90 million readers as rumored subscription service nears</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lOUbk8UAuuHu8ov1_DeDj03F004=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61906183/jbareham_160909_1215_B_0165.0.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="pqDkRV"&gt;Apple News has reached 90 million regular readers, three years after the app launched on iPhones and iPads. The stat comes out of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/apple-news-humans-algorithms.html"&gt;a story this morning in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which got to go behind the scenes with the Apple News team to see how it works. The &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;also furthers reports that Apple is close to launching a subscription service inside the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MuvEj4"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/17/17246332/apple-news-subscription-service-rumors"&gt;already rumors&lt;/a&gt; that Apple plans to turn its News app into a bigger venture, and the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;backs those up. Its story says that Apple plans to “bundle access to dozens of magazines” for a monthly fee, much like Netflix does for TV shows and movies. Newspapers could be included in the bundle, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5Qk8R"&gt;That wouldn’t be a huge surprise. Apple bought a service called Texture earlier...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Maps now lets you ‘follow’ your go-to locations</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="caBmXb"&gt;Google Maps for Android is getting a new feature today: &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/maps/fresh-ways-stay-date-your-favorite-places-and-find-new-ones/"&gt;the option to follow locations and businesses&lt;/a&gt; like you would an account on a social network, letting you stay in the loop on any news, events, or upcoming offers that are featured there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPN1dQ"&gt;Those updates will show up in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/26/17506506/google-maps-explore-for-you-tab-redesign-launch"&gt;recently added “For You” tab&lt;/a&gt; that Google already uses as a personalized feed of local recommendations and restaurants. Allowing users to personalize that section a bit more by adding their favorite stores seems like a natural extension of the functionality, especially as Google seems to be set on adding more social features to Maps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10TCIy"&gt;After all, it’s easy to imagine a jump from following stores to following friends and having their comments and reviews pop up in your...&lt;/p&gt;
