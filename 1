    <title>The new Nintendo Labo vehicle kit is the best one yet</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5pmpLSsQRPQInkaVb4PvnTa89LU=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61381463/Switch_NintendoLabo_VehicleKit_photo_05.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="2dSwq1"&gt;When Nintendo first released Labo — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/18/17253574/nintendo-labo-review-switch-learning-diy"&gt;a line of DIY cardboard accessories for the Switch&lt;/a&gt; — it did a lot of things right. The kits balanced a fine line between being fun toys and useful learning tools. You could build your own cardboard piano, get a lesson on how it actually functions, and then make music with kitten sounds. Despite coming from Nintendo, however, the first batch of Labo kits weren’t exactly great games; they were simple toys without much lasting appeal. If you weren’t into learning rudimentary coding or endlessly fishing a virtual sea, there wasn’t much to keep you coming back. Even with two young kids in the house, my Labo kits sat in a closet all summer, rarely used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2b6gm"&gt;With the new vehicle kit, which launches on Friday, the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A.Human is a sci-fi fashion show about changing your body instead of your clothes</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="Viper &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;is part of A. Human’s ‘biological heel’ series. It is displayed here on a live model.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u5NVB6ZHhgz_x88dz7FSxGYkU-I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61381733/akrales_180905_2922_0230_02.0.jpg" /&gt;



  		 &lt;p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="L5TBdL"&gt;I spent at least half an hour wandering &lt;a href="https://www.ahumanbody.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A.Human&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — an art installation about a futuristic body modification fashion house — before realizing one of the models was a human being. This wasn’t totally unreasonable: he was mostly hidden behind a wall, revealing only a torso embellished with glowing lines. According to a small sign beside him, the lines were transdermal blacklight implants designed as club wear, which the label’s mysterious designer A. Huxley had dubbed “Carnaval.” I realized my mistake when I looked closer and saw his muscles twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqhwTK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A.Human&lt;/em&gt; is full of these reverse-uncanny-valley moments. The installation, which opened last week and runs through the end of September, feels like something David Cronenberg might create if he...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This smart power strip lets you individually control each outlet</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c3aqeCeQ4onuDdFXwaUOHuLgU0E=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61381587/kasastrip.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="7qvTGd"&gt;There are an endless number of smart plugs that let you remotely turn an outlet on and off, but those plugs usually accept just one single cable. So to address bigger needs, Kasa is introducing an entire smart power strip that allows you to individually control all six of its power sockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hTYj5"&gt;The Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Power Strip has six power sockets, which can be controlled through an app or by voice assistants, as well as three USB ports that always remain powered on. Kasa, which comes from the router company TP-Link, is far from the first to make a smart power strip, but it is perhaps the first major brand to do so. And given that, when it comes to power strips, you really want to buy from a legitimate brand, that makes this announcement a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus announces super cheap USB-C earbuds</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;OnePlus Type-C Bullets.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P9dV6L9vK8g02b8iWiR2fB3sses=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61381571/onepluscc.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="4R7SQR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finally!&lt;/em&gt; OnePlus has just announced the product that so many Android phone users have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/11/10/16633516/google-pixel-2-earbuds-dongle-xiaomi-usb-c-price"&gt;crying out for&lt;/a&gt; for many months: cheap, yet high-quality USB-C earphones to replace the analog ones we can no longer use with our phones that are deprived of headphone jacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSLaWe"&gt;The new OnePlus Type-C Bullets are an upgraded version of the very good Bullets Wireless that I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/11/16/13648966/oneplus-bullets-v2-headphones-review"&gt;reviewed back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. The Bullets v2 were priced at $19.99, and OnePlus promises to keep the price unchanged with its new USB-C edition, while adding a few design and feature updates. The Type-C Bullets will come with a built-in Cirrus Logic DAC, which should make them compatible with most USB-C devices, including laptops and tablets. They’ll also have a built-in microphone and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s worse than a dongle? No dongle</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KtuNNhr-OTXxAJBFzkBTRiV6DXs=/401x123:1952x1157/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61381231/Image_from_iOS.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="LhBHnn"&gt;Apple’s iPhone launch event yesterday was so full of good news that the company apparently couldn’t find the time to disclose a couple of less happy developments in its product range. Firstly, the three-year-old iPhone 6S and two-year-old iPhone SE models are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17824594/apple-iphone-x-6s-se-discontinued-2018-event"&gt;being discontinued&lt;/a&gt;, which is significant because they were the last remaining iPhones with headphone jacks that Apple was selling. Secondly and relatedly, the Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter that Apple used to ship in the box with its iPhones is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17827970/no-more-free-iphone-dongles"&gt;now gone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jstG2"&gt;Whether you’re buying an iPhone XS, XR, 8, or 7, from today you will no longer have a direct way to connect your wired headphones to your shiny new device. The dongle that previously came free in the box is now only...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Can Apple’s iPhone XS camera catch up to Google’s Pixel?</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7zGt3yhb8z1tLYJ9Zs-jJNnmTEk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61380767/9U3A0116.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="sYowgf"&gt;As ever, the camera system is one of the most important features in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847036/apple-iphone-xs-hands-on-features-photos-video-camera-2018"&gt;the new iPhones&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s SVP of product marketing Phil Schiller played the same role he always does at each iPhone announcement, breaking down the camera technology in depth and explaining the improvements. This year he went as far as to pronounce that the iPhone XS will hail “a new era of photography.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ba9EEy"&gt;But the days where Apple held a major lead over every Android manufacturer are long gone. Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/18/13315168/google-pixel-camera-software-marc-levoy"&gt;innovative approach to computational photography&lt;/a&gt; with the Pixel line means they’re now the phones to beat in terms of pure image quality, while competitors like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/13/17099184/galaxy-s9-pixel-2-camera-photo-comparison"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S9 Plus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/6/17198708/huawei-p20-pro-review"&gt;Huawei’s P20 Pro&lt;/a&gt; have strong claims to supremacy in areas like low-light performance....&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Google’s internal political battles keep spilling out into the public</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U7cbVNnNDa0feYw5j082DGXEor4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61377463/mdoying_180117_2249_0272stills.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="htD4lT"&gt;It’s an unhappy time at Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXFt7x"&gt;Ever since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/5/16101978/google-employee-wrote-anti-diversity-manifesto?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"&gt;the James Damore controversy&lt;/a&gt; last year, Google has faced regular eruptions from unhappy employees who wish to protest the company’s politics in public. In January, a former security engineer said he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882270/google-diversity-hiring-executives-cory-altheide?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"&gt;had been stopped from sharing his pro-diversity views&lt;/a&gt;. This summer, a group of employees successfully pressured the company to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/1/17418406/google-maven-drone-imagery-ai-contract-expire?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"&gt;stop building an AI project for the military&lt;/a&gt;. A similar group is now pushing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/16/17702464/google-search-censorship-china-protest-project-dragonfly?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"&gt;to prevent the company from re-entering China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZDqcy"&gt;All of this has played out in unusually public ways — and against a political backdrop that has grown increasingly unfriendly to Google and its parent company, Alphabet. President Trump &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/technology/google-trump-bias.html?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"&gt;has repeatedly tweeted baseless allegations&lt;/a&gt; that the company is...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Master &amp; Dynamic’s first truly wireless earbuds cost $299 and come in four colors</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i8YRCxNN9tLvoW9kH7KGWF0Dm8M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61377789/akrales_180912_2931_0051.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="UPh58F"&gt;Master &amp;amp; Dynamic is no stranger to making unique headphones, but the new MW07 earbuds are the first time it’s dabbled in truly wireless earbuds. These AirPod competitors &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterdynamic.com%2F" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cost $299 starting today&lt;/a&gt;, last 3.5 hours on a charge, and can recharge from their case to reach a total of 14 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oo2AbU"&gt;Like any consumer hardware company, Master &amp;amp; Dynamic has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/5/17525694/master-dynamic-mw50-review-weak-magnetism"&gt;had some design missteps &lt;/a&gt;but the MW07s are a step in a different direction: luxury materials meet portability. The MW07s use handcrafted acetate covers — just like a pair of pricey sunglasses — to give each earbud a completely unique pattern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdTWL6"&gt;At launch, Master &amp;amp; Dynamic will offer the MW07s in tortoiseshell, steel blue, grey terrazzo, and matte black acetate finishes. PVD-coated stainless steel...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reveals new prices for iPhone battery replacements that go into effect January 1st</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jvpdsMX3BXOAcy_KzIGKwdRmLvI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61376195/DSCF3201.0.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="09W646"&gt;Walking into your local Apple Store and getting a battery replacement for your iPhone is pretty cheap at the moment. Just $29. But when 2018 comes to a close, that temporary pricing — introduced in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/28/16827248/apple-iphone-battery-replacement-price-slow-down-apology"&gt;last year’s throttling controversy&lt;/a&gt; that affected iPhones with aging batteries — will be going away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sh6hq3"&gt;Ahead of that change, as &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/09/12/apple-announces-new-iphone-battery-repair-prices-after-29-offer-ends-at-end-of-year/"&gt;noted by&lt;em&gt; 9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Apple has &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/battery-power"&gt;updated its battery page&lt;/a&gt; with the new rates that will begin on January 1st. In 2019, out-of-warranty battery swaps will cost:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
