    <title>Master &amp; Dynamic’s first truly wireless earbuds cost $299 and come in four colors</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i8YRCxNN9tLvoW9kH7KGWF0Dm8M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61377789/akrales_180912_2931_0051.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="UPh58F"&gt;Master &amp;amp; Dynamic is no stranger to making unique headphones, but the new MW07 earbuds are the first time it’s dabbled in truly wireless earbuds. These AirPod competitors &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterdynamic.com%2F" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cost $299 starting today&lt;/a&gt;, last 3.5 hours on a charge, and can recharge from their case to reach a total of 14 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oo2AbU"&gt;Like any consumer hardware company, Master &amp;amp; Dynamic has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/5/17525694/master-dynamic-mw50-review-weak-magnetism"&gt;had some design missteps &lt;/a&gt;but the MW07s are a step in a different direction: luxury materials meet portability. The MW07s use handcrafted acetate covers — just like a pair of pricey sunglasses — to give each earbud a completely unique pattern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdTWL6"&gt;At launch, Master &amp;amp; Dynamic will offer the MW07s in tortoiseshell, steel blue, grey terrazzo, and matte black acetate finishes. PVD-coated stainless steel...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reveals new prices for iPhone battery replacements that go into effect January 1st</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jvpdsMX3BXOAcy_KzIGKwdRmLvI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61376195/DSCF3201.0.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="09W646"&gt;Walking into your local Apple Store and getting a battery replacement for your iPhone is pretty cheap at the moment. Just $29. But when 2018 comes to a close, that temporary pricing — introduced in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/28/16827248/apple-iphone-battery-replacement-price-slow-down-apology"&gt;last year’s throttling controversy&lt;/a&gt; that affected iPhones with aging batteries — will be going away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sh6hq3"&gt;Ahead of that change, as &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/09/12/apple-announces-new-iphone-battery-repair-prices-after-29-offer-ends-at-end-of-year/"&gt;noted by&lt;em&gt; 9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Apple has &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/battery-power"&gt;updated its battery page&lt;/a&gt; with the new rates that will begin on January 1st. In 2019, out-of-warranty battery swaps will cost:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hE8gcn"&gt;iPhone XS, XS Max, XR, X: $69&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QOHxwK"&gt;iPhone 8, 8 Plus, 7, 7 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus, 6, 6 Plus, SE: $49&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jxC7wq"&gt;All other eligible models: $79&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="YJsy1H"&gt;People with iPhones under warranty or covered by AppleCare+ won’t have to pay anything for battery replacements. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Breitbart posted a leaked video of Google’s first all-hands meeting after the 2016 election</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="RV2rfF"&gt;Breitbart published &lt;a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/09/12/leaked-video-google-leaderships-dismayed-reaction-to-trump-election/"&gt;a leaked video from Google’s first all-hands meeting after the 2016 US presidential election&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, in a move that could serve as ammunition for claims that the tech company has acted in ways that are biased against conservatives. In the meeting, a series of Google executives acknowledges the disappointment and fears of many of their employees in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s election as president, while also acknowledging that the process was fair and that Google employees have a wide range of political opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UavuTD"&gt;“Most people here are pretty upset and pretty sad,” Google cofounder Sergey Brin says as the meeting begins. “I find this election deeply offensive, and I know many of you do too. It’s a stressful...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch Series 4 is thinner than previous models but bulkier than the original</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_i17O8ifZQlbUiAsshgdTS1bIkM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61375839/Image_from_iOS__9_.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="wspXTB"&gt;Apple announced the Apple Watch Series 4 today, which it touted as being thinner than previous models. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fwatch%2Fcompare%2F" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This is only partially true&lt;/a&gt;: the upcoming fourth-generation Apple Watch &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;the thinnest since the Series 3, which had an 11.4mm case compared to this year’s 10.7mm version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ScgNs"&gt;However, if you compare the Series 4 to the first-generation Apple Watch, you’ll find that the newer model is 0.2mm thicker; the original came in at just 10.5mm when it launched in 2015. (Of course, the Series 2 added GPS and water resistance, so it’s hard to fault Apple for adding 0.9mm of thickness to the overall case.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>How the iPhone XS and XS Max stack up against the top Android phones</title>

  &lt;p id="if9KXD"&gt;Apple unveiled the newest generation of its flagship iPhones today, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847036/apple-iphone-xs-hands-on-features-photos-video-camera-2018"&gt;the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max&lt;/a&gt;. The models share a lot of the features that their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17824594/apple-iphone-x-6s-se-discontinued-2018-event"&gt;discontinued predecessor&lt;/a&gt; first introduced to the iPhone line, like Face ID and Portrait Mode, but now they’ve been fine-tuned and improved. One of the biggest upgrades is the switch to Apple’s new A12 Bionic processor, which is said to be 15 percent faster than the A11. It’s also notable that these features are now available in the form of a 6.5-inch XS Max, which is the largest iPhone ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4B7KD"&gt;One of the highlighted demonstrations onstage today was the ability to manually adjust the depth of field after taking photos in Portrait Mode. Despite Apple’s claims that “this has not been possible...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirPower charger is still a no-show, one year after it was first announced</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yJylf0v8s8icq3NiUfARdMNYVMw=/0x2:970x649/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61374513/airpower.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="0chEk7"&gt;Apple’s big iPhone event has come and gone, with&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17842438/apple-iphone-event-news-updates-xs-xr-watch-4-2018"&gt; the company highlighting&lt;/a&gt; its new iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR models along with the updated Apple Watch Series 4. But one thing was conspicuously missing — Apple’s AirPower wireless charger, which was announced at &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; year’s iPhone event, and still has yet to come out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dfejqb"&gt;Today marks the one year anniversary of Apple’s AirPower announcement, which was shown off alongside the iPhone X and Apple Watch Series 3. At the time, Apple promised that the AirPower charging pad would be out sometime in 2018, but in the full year since that original announcement, we still haven’t heard official updates from either its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/23/17155630/apple-keynote-education-event-2018-cheap-ipad"&gt;March iPad event&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17410820/apple-wwdc-summary-updates-highlights-news-2018"&gt;WWDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beats headphones get new colors to match the iPhone XS and XR</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1D_O3G4JQ4SskWhtHQW4gi1Dzus=/0x0:7200x4800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61373071/MUHU2_urBeats3_SunYellow_RGB_FrontDetail_v2_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="rbNd81"&gt;Every few months, Apple refreshes Beats’ lineup of headphones with some new color options. We’re getting another one of those refreshes today, with colors that match Apple’s new phones, the iPhone XS and XR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uStxrP"&gt;Three new colors are coming to the urBeats3. They now come in yellow, blue, and coral to match some (but not all) of the iPhone XR colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUGpHM"&gt;The urBeats3 are pretty typical in-ear earbuds, but they terminate in a Lightning cable so that they can plug directly into phones like the iPhone XR, which don’t have a headphone jack. They cost $60, which is a bit expensive for what are realistically some pretty basic earbuds. But that’s the price you pay for getting locked into the Apple accessory ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pl1IFD"&gt;Beats’ Solo 3 Wireless are also...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify raises limit for offline downloads to 10,000 songs per device</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iYp34eO4fRWYyeiEJOqK7iOwH8Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61372869/akrales_180620_1777_0233.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="fqC4mq"&gt;Spotify is improving of one of its most annoying, arbitrary limits. The music streaming app has increased the cap for maximum number of offline downloads, which was previously stuck at 3,333 songs per device (on a maximum of three devices). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwLmmm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/spotify-lifts-3333-song-download-limit-723235/"&gt;As reported by &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that limit has now been raised to 10,000 songs — and you can download that many tunes on five different devices instead of just three. So you’re looking at 50,000 in all. “At Spotify, we’re always working on improving the experience for our users,” a company spokesperson told Rolling Stone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Z7iRk"&gt;Unfortunately, Spotify’s other annoying ceiling — a 10,000 track limit on your personal library — remains very much in place. That’s really the one I keep running into. Once you hit...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Apple starts offering optional loss and theft protection for new iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="rxfmCn"&gt;The main downside of AppleCare+, Apple’s extended warranty program, has always been that it’s pretty much worthless if your device is lost or stolen. That’s been the primary factor that steers some people towards getting phone insurance through their carrier. But following today’s introduction of its latest iPhones, Apple is changing things up — and it’s going to start offering optional loss/theft protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u1URZk"&gt;As detailed on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupport%2Fproducts%2Fiphone.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this updated AppleCare+ website&lt;/a&gt;, AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss protection requires an iPhone to have Find My iPhone turned on in order to be eligible for replacement if lost. This doesn’t seem to be something you can retroactively add to existing AppleCare+ coverage; it’s a separate, more expensive plan that you’d...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
