				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After its go around my apartment,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/irobots-new-roomba-knows-where-its-going/"> the i7+</a> is “still learning.” It’s fitting sentiment for the new Roomba, which iRobot is positioning as much as a platform as a robotic vacuum. Like a smartphone, it’s designed to learn new tricks over the life of the product, through over the air updates. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this particular case, however, it’s learning the layout of my place. The i7+ builds on the moderately useful dirt mapping rolled out on the 900 series early last year. With a couple of cleans, the new Roomba gets to know the layout of your apartment, building a “Smart Map” in the process. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">iRobot claims such features will have added usefulness as time goes by, including the long-promised ability to serve as a sort of connective tissue for a user’s smart home. For now, however, they serve one key role: teaching the robot to distinguish one room from the next. That means, after a couple of cleans, you’ll be able to designate a bedroom accordingly and tell the Roomba to go clean the bedroom.</span></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/_hIdPLpO5jI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The utility there is pretty straight forward, I think. Before this, cleaning a specific room was a matter of waiting for the vacuum to clean the entire space — or, as I’ve more often done, picked the damn thing up, walked to the room, placed it down and hit Clean. That, of course, doesn’t comport with iRobot’s ultimate goal of keeping the robot out of sight. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even with the new model, I still find myself doing this. Until the Roomba is sophisticated enough to overcome great obstacles like doorway thresholds and can conveniently navigate around my living room without disturbing my rabbit, I’m going to have to continue doing this to some degree. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What’s interesting here though, is that the robot is smart enough to understand when it has been moved to a different room and starts drawing up a new map, accordingly. After one trip around the bedroom and living room (which make up most my apartment) and two goes through my weirdly long entry hallway, it’s at 70 and 95 percent of the maps, respectively.</span></p>
<p><img class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1715116" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG-2927.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="847" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After it’s learned the different rooms, the Roomba continues to update as it goes along. I’ve noticed already some differences between sweeps. Maybe there was something in the way on the floor or the vacuum just didn’t get to it for some reason. In the future, I may rearrange my furniture, and the Roomba will have to adjust accordingly. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is all still early stages for me and the new Roomba, and I do plan to revisit the hardware once we’ve had a bit more time together. In the meantime, I’m pretty impressed with how the device has been refined over the generations. There are little touches here and there, like swapping the mechanical buttons for flush touch ones, making it less sensitive to things like water and dust.</span></p>
<p><img class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1715118" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG-2932.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Roomba says the i7 is quieter than previous generations. It is a bit, though it’s not silent by any stretch — and things get really loud when you add in the Clean base. The process of automatically emptying the bin is short, but man is it loud. Still, there’s a lot to be said for only having to empty it about one-thirtieth of the time. So far, that process works like a charm. When it’s finished, the Roomba simply mounts the base and goes to work. You can also go through the process manually via the app.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Between the improved hardware, mapping and the simple app, which errs of the side of offering almost too much information, it’s hard to complain about the experience the new Roomba affords. Of course, it will cost you.</span></p>
<p><img class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1715121" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG-2934.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The i7 alone is $700. The i7+ with clean base is $950, which I suspect is pushing the boundaries of what people will pay for a robotic vacuum. Granted, iRobot has proven that people are willing to spend for the sort of maintenance a Roomba provides, given that the product is currently the number one vacuum in the U.S. But if the i7 is the iPhone XR, the i7+ is the iPhone XS Max. The advantages are obvious, but you’re going to pay for them. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is getting ready to purposefully influence the U.S. mid-term elections after spending two years trying to safeguard against foreign interference. Instagram <a href="https://instagram-press.com/blog/2018/09/18/helping-our-community-register-to-vote/">plans to run</a> ads in Stories and feed powered by TurboVote that will target all US users over 18 and point them towards information on how to get properly registered and abide by voting rules. Then when election day arrives, users will be able to add an &#8220;I Voted&#8221; sticker to their photos and videos that link to <a href="https://gttp.votinginfoproject.org/">voting info</a> like which polling place to go to.</p>
<p>Combined, these efforts could boost voter turnout, especially amongst Instagram&#8217;s core audience of millenials. If one political party&#8217;s base skews younger, they could receive an advantage.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-1715157 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Facebook-Vote.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="209" /></p>
<p>In 2010, a non-partisan &#8220;Get out the vote&#8221; message atop the Facebook News Feed was estimated to have driven 340,000 additional votes. The study by Nature suggested that “more of the 0.6% growth in turnout between 2006 and 2010 might have been caused by a single message on Facebook”. That&#8217;s significant considering the 2000 election had a margin of just 0.1 percent of voters.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rent-the-runway" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rent-the-runway">Rent the Runway, the <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> fashion startup that began as a rental service for special occasions and has since evolved over the last couple of years into a service for people also looking to spice up their everyday wear, just opened up its <a href="https://www.renttherunway.com/stories/stores">fifth physical, standalone location</a>. The new location, in downtown San Francisco, enables Rent the Runway members to try on clothes, rent and return them.</p>
<p>Rent the Runway&#8217;s launch of a standalone brick-and-mortar location in San Francisco comes after it first opened up a location inside Neiman Marcus. With a standalone location, the company is able to offer longer hours for its members. Instead of opening at 10 a.m. and closing at 7 p.m., Rent the Runway can now stay open from 9 a.m. &#8211; 8 p.m. Monday through Friday. It also, of course, has weekend hours.</p>
<p>Thanks to some technology Rent the Runway developed within the last year, it has essentially &#8220;legalized shoplifting&#8221; for its members, Rent the Runway COO Maureen Sullivan told me yesterday ahead of the store&#8217;s launch. Toward the front of the store, there&#8217;s a self-return process that enables anyone to quickly return their items. A little farther back in the store, there&#8217;s a handful of self-checkout kiosks that let members quickly scan their items and leave.</p>
<p><img class="breakout alignnone wp-image-1714999" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/N9A7332.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p>Since its launch about nine years ago, Rent the Runway has launched two additional product offerings. In addition to its standard Reserve product, a one-time rental, Rent the Runway now offers two subscription products. The first is called Unlimited, which lets members rent four items at a time on a constant rotation (meaning you can swap them out as much as you want) for $159 a month.</p>
<p>The second is called Update, which lets you rent just four items for the whole month for $89 per month. In the event someone really likes what they&#8217;ve rented, they always have the option to purchase the item at anywhere from 10 percent to 75 percent off. Today, the subscription products make up 50 percent of Rent the Runway&#8217;s revenue, with San Francisco as the third largest subscription market.</p>
<p><img class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1715004" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/N9A7555-e1537280737402.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="771" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the nine years or so Rent the Runway has been around, a number of other services have cropped up around fashion. Stitch Fix, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/17/stitch-fix-up-just-1-on-first-day-of-trading-after-reducing-size-of-ipo/">which went public last November</a>, and Trunk Club by Nordstrom are two of the big ones. But what differentiates Rent the Runway from the likes of Stitch Fix is that, &#8220;they&#8217;re trying to get you to buy stuff,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;You&#8217;re still buying things that accumulate in your closet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The vision with Rent the runway is to get to the point where 50 percent of your closet is rented, and therefore less cluttered. Rent the Runway, for example, has some customers who wear rented clothes 120 days out of the year.</p>
<p>Rent the Runway currently partners with over 500 brands, and operates as a new type of distribution channel for them. What Rent the Runway offers for brands is marketing and discovery, and customer data.</p>
<p>Down the road, Rent the Runway does envision getting into men&#8217;s clothing Sullivan said, but right now, there&#8217;s &#8220;unprecedented growth&#8221; in women&#8217;s clothing, so that&#8217;s where the focus will be for now.</p>
<p>Back in August, Rent the Runway partnered with Temasek for a $200 million credit facility. Before that deal, Rent the Runway had raised more than $200 million from traditional investors like KPCBC, Highland Capital, Bain Capital, TCV and others.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Assassin’s Creed Odyssey Echo Plus is a limited edition, which will no doubt make fans want the thing that much more. It’s a standard Amazon device that Ubisoft dressed up in a Spartan helmet, to be given away in small quantities through the company’s site. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ridiculous thing is the game maker’s way of promoting a new Alexa skill, designed to provide useful tips for the upcoming action role-playing title. The download will be available for all Echo devices (Greek battle helmet or no) starting October 2 — three days before Assassin’s Creed Odyssey officially hits consoles.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.spire.io/">Spire&#8217;s Health Tags</a>, the dark and tiny devices you stick on your clothes to gather all sorts of health data from your steps, heartbeat and stress levels is now available at your local Apple Store.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/17/spire-breath-taker/">started out</a> with a breath tracking device to detect when you are feeling tense and help calm you down. But four years in and its now all about the wearable &#8220;tags&#8221; you stick on items of clothing like your pants or sports bra.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, there are lots of gadgets out there to gather similar information &#8212; the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Watch will now even detect if you have a fall or something is wrong with your heart &#8212; but the Spire health tag is nothing like a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fitbit" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fitbit">Fitbit <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> or Apple Watch, according to the company. For one, there&#8217;s zero need to charge the device. One tag&#8217;s battery will last a year and a half before dying out. They&#8217;re also machine washable. You just pick a few outfits and stick a tag on each of them.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1714667" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/HealthTag_Held-Close-e1537245186333.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="331" /></p>
<p>Of course a few other startups out there are working on making smart, washable, data-gathering clothes. <a href="https://www.getenflux.com/">Enflux</a> makes the clothing and then sews in the motion sensor to tell you if you are lifting correctly. <a href="https://vitaliwear.com/">Vitali</a> is a &#8220;smart&#8221; bra with a built-in sensor to detect stress. Then there&#8217;s <a href="https://www.omsignal.com/">OmSignal</a>, which makes body-hugging workout clothes that gather &#8220;medical-grade biometric data to achieve optimal health.&#8221; But these tiny health tags are different in that they allow you to choose the clothes you want to adhere the monitor to.</p>
<p>Like Spire&#8217;s first product, the Stone, which earned more than $8 million in sales, according to the company, the tags will also pick up on times of stress and help calm you down through a series of breaths and focus on the app.</p>
<p>&#8220;Continuous health data will revolutionize health and wellness globally, but early incarnations have been hampered by poor user experiences and a focus on the hardware over the outcomes that the hardware can create,” Spire&#8217;s founder Jonathan Palley said. &#8220;By making the device ‘disappear’, we believe Health Tag is the first product to unlock the potential.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spire&#8217;s Health Tags will be sold in Apple Stores as a three-pack for $130, six-pack for $230 and an eight-pack for $300, with additional pack sizes available on the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.spire.io/">website</a>.</p>

[&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#8217;s focus on using its camera-enabled Echo devices to help you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/07/echo-look-to-dole-out-fashion-advice-from-vogue-and-gq/">figure out what to wear everyday</a> has highlighted how the tech world sees a big opportunity in building fashion-related tools and services beyond the now-ubiquitous but still quite basic business of e-commerce, where clothes are displayed on websites, and ordered for delivery to your home. Now one of the latest startups in the space has raised a seed round from an interesting group of investors.</p>
<p>Maison Me, a startup that has built a platform that lets people provide either a few clues, or very specific detail, of a piece of clothing that they would like, and then makes it to order, has raised $1 million to build out its business from backers that include Founders Fund, the new <a href="https://developers.google.com/actions/assistant-investments">Google Assistant investment program</a>, Gagarin Capital and others that are not being named for now. Maison Me&#8217;s co-founder and CEO Anastasia Sartan said that the startup will be using the money to continue optimising its services and building for new platforms such as Google Home.</p>
<p>That particular device is a notable one to build for: currently Google doesn&#8217;t have a camera or screen, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/17/google-said-to-be-releasing-its-own-smart-display-this-year/">many reports speculate</a> that it will be launching a new version very soon that will. Meanwhile, Amazon is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/17/amazon-taps-getty-to-provide-images-for-visual-searches-on-the-echo-show-and-echo-spot/">level-pegging</a> on me-too functionality.</p>
<p>Google of course is not saying anything about any upcoming hardware, and sees Maison Me as something useful for the Google Home speaker that we know today, and for the displays out there not made by Google that are being powered by it.</p>
<p>“A lot of people start their daily routines asking their Google Home speakers for a weather forecast, looking for some help before they pick out their outfits for the day,&#8221; said ​Ilya Gelfenbeyn, head of the Google Assistant investment program, in a statment. &#8220;Smart Displays with the Google Assistant make it possible to build services and recommendations in such a visual industry like fashion, and we believe that personalized what-to-wear recommendations can really simplify the morning routines for people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maison Me will have its first Google app of its clothing service ready in the beginning of November. But Maison Me (and Epytom, which is the name of the actual startup) has been in business for a while already, starting first with a chatbot that helped people figure out what to wear &#8212; data, Sartan said, has been used to help feed its algorithms for its clothing-making service. That bot is still active and has racked up 300,000 users so far.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google is emphasizing routines in voice assistants,&#8221; Sartan explained. &#8220;In the morning, 78 percent of people ask about the weather. But why? It is to figure out what to wear. Knowing the location and preferences and we can help here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pitch that Maison Me is making for the clothing service is that it can go from specs to delivery in 15 days &#8212; longer than a Prime-style turnaround of a day, or nipping out to the shops for a quick purchase, but potentially more rewarding and individualised. The garments, she said, are all made in the US.</p>
<p>Within those two weeks there are a number of stages: After a conversation about the garment-to-come, which includes questions about a buyer&#8217;s interests beyond fashion, the data goes through algorithms created by Maison Me and then handed off to a human (not robot!) designer. A custom sketch is made for approval or modifications. All of that costs $15.</p>
<p>Then comes the making of the garment. A professional tailor &#8212; again, not a bot or computer vision program &#8212; takes a customer&#8217;s measurements and starts to produce the clothes, which end up with the user within 15 days.</p>
<div title="Page 2">
<p>One of the big issues that Sartan says she was trying to tackle is &#8220;dead stock&#8221; &#8212; the massive amount of overproduction that fashion houses and retailers create in the process of making mass-produced clothes. The creation and &#8220;disposal&#8221; of dead stock &#8212; in order for a brand to continue to have cachet &#8212; has been the subject of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliviapinnock/2018/07/20/no-one-in-fashion-is-surprised-burberry-burnt-28-million-of-stock/">some controversy</a> in the fashion industry, since not only does it fundamentally feel wasteful, but there is an environmental impact as well.</p>
<p>“Dead stock is the burden of the global fashion industry and the environment, and so are the unmet customers’ expectations regarding the fit, quality, and cost. Our goal now is to create clothes you reach for the most, because they fit your body and life perfectly, go with the rest of your wardrobe, and are truly worth their price,&#8221; Sartan said.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The State Department has confirmed a data breach affecting an unknown number of employees.</p>
<p>A spokesperson told TechCrunch that the breach affected &#8220;less than 1 percent&#8221; of unclassified employee inboxes. &#8220;We have not detected activity of concern in the Department’s classified email system.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We determined that certain employee personally identifiable information may have been exposed and those employees were notified,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The department said an interagency investigation — including help from the private sector — is underway and declined to share further information.</p>
<p>Politico was <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/17/state-department-email-personal-information-792665">first to report</a> the incident, citing a notice on the department&#8217;s internal pages.</p>
<p>State is said to be using Microsoft&#8217;s Office 365 cloud-based email service for unclassified work.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not known what&#8217;s to blame for the breach. A report published earlier this year by administration watchdog Government Accountability Office said that the State Department had only rolled out some form of two-factor authentication to 11 percent of required agency devices, despite a legal requirement to secure all accounts with higher privileges.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/ron-wyden" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="ron-wyden">Ron Wyden, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a Democratic senator from Oregon, and several bipartisan colleagues, said <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/state-dept-cybersecurity-letter-from-wyden-gardner-paul-markey-shaheen.pdf">in a letter last week</a> that the department was &#8220;failing to meet federal cybersecurity standards&#8221; that could make it &#8220;significantly harder for foreign governments or criminals to access accounts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act, signed into law in 2015, requires every agency to improve cybersecurity practices.</p>
<p>The law was introduced after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/17/us-government-begins-outreach-to-office-of-personnel-management-hack-victims/">a catastrophic data breach</a> at the Office of Personnel Management months earlier, exposing over 21 million records of security-cleared government employees, including their biometrics.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not known if the two are linked but the state of cybersecurity at State doesn&#8217;t look so good right now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon wants developers to build their own Alexa Gadgets. As you may recall, Amazon last year launched its own gadgets &#8211; those <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/27/heres-why-amazon-made-those-weird-echo-buttons/">weird, Bluetooth-connected Echo Buttons</a> &#8211; but<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/08/amazons-echo-buttons-are-just-the-start-more-form-factors-to-launch-this-year/"> told us this year at CES</a> that it had plans to open up gadget-building to the wider developer community. Now, it has. The company today is launching the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/alexa-gadgets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexa Gadgets Toolkit</a> into beta, allowing developers to build accessories that pair with Echo over Bluetooth.</p>
<p>The gadgets themselves could use things like lights, sound chips, or even motors, and can work with Alexa interfaces like notifications, timers, reminders, text-to-speech, or wake word detection. For example, you could create a device designed for outdoor use that chimes when a timer has concluded, or a switch that drops dog food into a bowl when an alarm expires. A pill box could chime or flash to remind you to take medications, and so on.</p>
<p>Support for interacting with music will be added soon, Amazon says. Yes, that&#8217;s right &#8211; Big Mouth Billy Bass will respond to Alexa voice commands and dance to music streamed via Alexa, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/27/amazons-alexa-will-live-in-a-talking-fish/">promised</a>. It&#8217;s no longer just a <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2016/11/04/finally-at-long-last-someone-hacked-amazons-alexa-into-one-of-those-singing-fish/?_ga=2.2903476.569346782.1537190189-1510196584.1533849207">hack</a>.</p>
<p>The Alexa Gadgets Toolkit offers self-service APIs, including Gadget Interfaces that expose metadata of Alexa’s capabilities on compatible Echo devices, as well as technical documentation, sample code and more.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1715067" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-18-at-11.05.01-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="302" /></p>
<p>Already, a number of companies are building Alexa Gadgets, including <a href="https://www.hasbro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hasbro</a>, <a href="https://wowwee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WowWee Group Limited</a>, <a href="https://www.gemmy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemmy Industries</a>, <a href="http://babyplus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baby Plus</a>, <a href="https://tomy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TOMY International</a>, <a href="https://www.novalia.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Novalia</a>, and <a href="https://ihome.com/press" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eKids (an affiliate of iHome).</a> The partners aren&#8217;t necessarily detailing their creations at this point, but have offered some hints.</p>
<p>Toy maker Hasbro is working on immersive play experiences; TOMY will bring hands-free assistance to parents using its products; WowWee is creating Alexa-connected smart toothbrushes; BabyPlus is offering a connected rubber duckie that controls smart home devices and streams music; and Novalia is developing a touch-sensitive mat for kids&#8217; immersive play.</p>
<p>These products will later be <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=17045325011">sold on Amazon</a>, the retailer notes, starting later this year with the updated Big Mouth Billy Bass from Gemmy Industries.</p>
<p>The news comes just ahead of an Amazon Alexa press event, where the company is preparing to announce a variety of new Alexa devices. According to a recent <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/17/amazon-planning-8-new-alexa-devices-microwave-amplifier.html">CNBC report</a>, Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/17/amazon-reportedly-has-an-alexa-microwave-and-more-on-the-way/">has at least 8 in the works</a>, including a microwave oven, subwoofer, and in-car gadget.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even bigger than the salary gap that sees women earn $.82 on the dollar is the equity gap. A new study from Carta and the ex-Twitter female investor group #Angels <a href="https://medium.com/angels-news/silicon-valleys-equity-gap-women-own-just-9-29159f40a17">reveals</a> that women make up 35 percent of startup equity-holding employees, yet own just 20 percent of the equity. That means they own just $0.47 for every $1 that men own. Even worse, women account for 13 percent of startup founder but just 6 percent of founder equity &#8212; or merely $0.39 on the dollar.</p>
<p>Combined, that means only 9 percent of founder and employee startup equity is owned by women.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1715065" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Founder-Equity-Gap.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="263" /></p>
<p>&#8220;This is not just about wealth&#8221; says #Angels&#8217; Chloe Sladden. &#8220;Wealth from successful exits goes on to shape the entire industry. It&#8217;s about who has power and who gets to decide what gets funded.&#8221; #Angels&#8217; Jessica Verrilli notes that &#8220;Having this data is going to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>be a watershed moment and catalyze more urgency to address this underrepresentation.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_1715109" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://blog.carta.com/gap-table/"><img class="wp-image-1715109 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Chloe-Sladden.png?w=410" alt="" width="410" height="504" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">#Angels&#8217; Chloe Sladden</p></div>
<p><a href="https://blog.carta.com/gap-table/">The study</a> by cap table management tool Carta (formerly eShares) looked at a subset of its privately held company customers including roughly 180,000 employees, 15,000 founders, and 6,000 companies encompassing $45 billion in equity value.</p>
<p>Amongst the hypothesized causes of the gap are that female-led startups get valued lower and diluted more, there&#8217;s less total capital allocated to wome due to investor and industry bias, the underrepresentation of women as investors, challenges facing women during negotiations, and that they often team-up with more co-founders that have to split the equity pool.</p>
<p>#Angels&#8217; Jana Messerschmidt explains that the gap table spotlights how women aren&#8217;t being hired for early engineering and leadership poisitions. These roles often get the lion&#8217;s share of equity, and when women are hired for sales, marketing, and HR jobs, &#8220;those folks are getting less equity because they are joining later and we have a hypothesis of how those roles are valued differently.&#8221; Sladden reminds founders to focus on diversity from day one. &#8220;Don&#8217;t push this off as something you&#8217;ll fix down the road as you&#8217;re facing all the other challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once a successful startup gets acquired or IPOs and paper money turns into cash, tech workers often reinvest their winnings into more startups as angels, fund LPs, or by starting their own venture firm. If only men are getting enough equity to make those downstream investments, their biases could further unbalance the gender breakdown of the tech industry. The #Angels say they&#8217;ve found this translates into fewer fundraising term sheets and bargaining power for female founders when they come to the Sand Hill Road boy&#8217;s club for venture capital.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1715097" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Startup-Gender-Composition-By-Size.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="359" /></p>
<p>Beyond more diverse hiring, the #Angels believe it&#8217;s critical that the industry dymystify equity so more women know how to exercise stock options and score tax advantages for maximum gain. &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t need to have an MBA to know the importance of equity and how to negotiate for it&#8221; says Sladden. Better financing avenues for those women who need up-front capital to exercise their stock options could also ensure it&#8217;s not just those who already have money who can make money through equity.</p>
<p class="p1">Sladden concludes, &#8220;We hope this is going to start a movement. We hope that CEOs will start to measure it and talk about it.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As iOS12 drops, we are again reminded that phone-based AR is on hundreds of millions of phones but we still haven&#8217;t seen any big successes built on the new technologies.</p>
<p><a href="http://illumix.com/">Illumix</a> is hoping that its approach to building games that understand where the user is while serving up content that responds to that space can help accelerate AR&#8217;s popularity.</p>
<p>The Menlo Park-based company is emerging out of stealth today and sharing that they&#8217;ve raised an $8.6 million seed round co-led by Maveron and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Radar Partners, Unusual Ventures and Michael Bay&#8217;s 451 Media also participated in the round.</p>
<p>The gaming studio is working on tech that allows gaming content to dynamically scale based on the environment. So, theoretically if you&#8217;re playing an Illumix title in a big open area like a warehouse, it&#8217;s going to look a lot different than if you fire up the app in your living room crammed with furniture. The startup is working on a couple of titles but is keeping them under tight wraps for now so I can&#8217;t speak to how this technology works in practice though the concepts seems pretty technically challenging.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s key is that this apparently won&#8217;t require users to pre-scan their space and that the content will effortlessly adapt thanks to &#8220;real-time understanding of the environment taken from the way a user would normally hold their phone,&#8221; Illumix co-founder Kirin Sinha tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>While the tech is an important part, Sinha claims the company is very much a game studio first and foremost and that the startup&#8217;s tech serves the creative ambition of their upcoming titles rather than just being developed to prove what is possible.</p>
<p>Next year, the studio plans to release a completely original title as well as a licensed game and will be using this latest bout of funding to grow the team of 11 and invest more in their upcoming work.</p>

That&#8217;s a milestone <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/18/uber-has-completed-2-billion-rides/">Uber hit in December 2015</a>. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has since grown to 10 billion trips completed &#8212; including Eats deliveries &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/uber-hits-10-billion-trips/">as of this past July</a>. Uber, of course, had a bit of head start given it launched in 2009 while Lyft first launched in 2012.</p>
<p>This milestone for Lyft comes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/05/lyft-is-now-completing-one-million-rides-a-day/">about a year after it announced it was completing one million rides a day</a>. To celebrate it, Lyft employees are surprising 3,500 drives with a free tank of gas.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Lyft officially entered the scooter sharing space when it launched electric scooters in Denver, Colo. Lyft has since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/18/lyft-deploys-electric-scooters-in-santa-monica/">deployed its scooters in Santa Monica, Calif</a>. as part of the city&#8217;s pilot program. Lyft&#8217;s entrance into scooters came close after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/02/its-official-lyft-bikes-is-now-a-thing/">acquisition of bike-share company Motivate</a>. We&#8217;ll be watching closely to see how Lyft&#8217;s additional modes of transportation impacts number of trips completed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Design tools are becoming increasingly important to just about every brand out there. Today, a new entrant joins the race.</p>
<p><a href="https://framer.com/">Framer X</a>, a revamped version of three-year-old <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/framer" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="framer">Framer, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was founded by Koen Bok and Jorn van Dijk after the duo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/09/facebook-sofa/">sold design software Sofa to Facebook in 2011</a>. Framer X is a rich, React-based design tool that lets any designer draw out their interface components and instantly send them over to the engineering team for collaboration.</p>
<p>The key here is reusability and fidelity. With Framer X, engineers can send over existing components that are in production and let designers move forward from there. Conversely, designers aren&#8217;t sending developers a facsimile of a button or icon but the actual SVG code behind that component.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iHwjBd8pkDM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Framer X also allows users to collect components and other design items as a package within the Framer X store, so that they&#8217;re easily accessible during the design process. Framer X offers a public Framer X Store where casual designers can build on the experience of advanced designers who&#8217;ve uploaded components to the store.</p>
<p>The company also allows enterprises to launch their own private store for use within the organization.</p>
<p>Framer costs $15/month for users, and private Framer X stores for the enterprise are priced flexibly based on the size of the organization.</p>
<p>Framer now joins a competitive landscape, which includes the likes of InVision, Adobe, and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sketch" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sketch">Sketch <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>The company says it has around 50,000 monthly active users, with 200 companies (including Google, Facebook and Dropbox) using the product. Framer has raised $9 million to date from Greylock, Foundation Capital, Designer Fund, and Accel Europe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lyft <a href="https://www.lyft.com/scooters/santa-monica-ca">has launched its electric scooters</a> in Santa Monica, Calif. as part of the city&#8217;s pilot program, joining both Bird and Lime, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/lyfts-electric-scooters-hit-the-streets-of-santa-monica/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0b&amp;linkId=56981735">CNET first reported</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the pilot program, Lyft can have up to 250 scooters on the streets at any one time. Riders must also be sure to stay within the service area of Santa Monica, and not venture out into the broader Los Angeles area. Otherwise, they&#8217;ll be fined.</p>
<p>Lyft&#8217;s launch in Santa Monica comes just a couple of weeks after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17824040/lyft-electric-scooter-denver-dockless-public-transportation">company deployed scooters in Denver, Colo</a>. Lyft&#8217;s scooters cost $1 to unlock and then 15 cents per minute to ride. They can travel up to 15 mph.</p>
<p>Lyft&#8217;s chief rival Uber/JUMP, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/30/santa-monica-will-allow-lime-bird-lyft-and-jump-to-operate-e-scooters/">which received a permit to operate in Santa Monica</a>, has yet to deploy any electric scooters. Though, it does have a partnership of sorts with Lime.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google&#8217;s parental control software for mobile devices, <a href="https://families.google.com/familylink/">Family Link</a>, will now help parents of teenagers, too. The company <a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/families/helping-more-families-set-digital-ground-rules-family-link/">announced</a> this morning the addition of new features aimed at parents of children over the age of 13. Perhaps the most controversial choice Google has made with this expansion is that teens can choose to turn off supervision via the software. While this does send an alert to parents, it&#8217;s a decidedly odd choice.</p>
<p>After all, if parents are planning on controlling smartphone use through Family Link &#8211; which lets them do things like manage and track screen time, view the location of the device, or control which apps are able to be installed, for example &#8211; it seems that parent and child would have already had a conversation about the topic.</p>
<p>And while it&#8217;s a nice gesture to ask teens to give consent to monitoring, it&#8217;s a hollow one &#8211; teens, after all, are still children, and parents likely bought them their device and are paying the phone bill. Parents at this point should have already established that using a phone is a privilege, not a right, and that there are ground rules, as well as what those rules are.</p>
<p>Parents should have had the conversation about how usage and location is tracked, and discussed what sort of content should or should not be viewed and shared on the teens&#8217; phone. Allowing the kid to just &#8220;opt out&#8221; should not be how that conversation starts.</p>
<p>Plus, you can&#8217;t really argue that teens could somehow be surreptitiously monitored by parents, given that parents are approving their app downloads and setting screen time limits, among other things, if on Family Link. They must have some awareness there&#8217;s a control mechanism in place.</p>
<p>The software&#8217;s support for teens rolls out this week worldwide, Google says, as part of Family Link&#8217;s global expansion. The applicable <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409">age</a> for a teen varies by country, but in the U.S. it&#8217;s 13. The app will also be available for Chromebook devices. And soon, parents will be able to manage Family Link devices through Google Assistant voice commands, too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On-demand delivery service <a href="http://postmates.com">Postmates</a> announced this morning that it has raised $300 million in additional funding led by Tiger Global Management.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/postmates-secures-300m-in-venture-funding-led-by-tiger-global-management-and-announces-record-breaking-year-of-growth-accelerating-position-as-the-on-demand-industry-leader-300714344.html">the company&#8217;s press release</a> doesn&#8217;t mention this, <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/09/18/postmates-funding-unicorn/">Fortune reports</a> that the deal valued Postmates at $1.2 billion. Tiger&#8217;s Scott Schleifer is joining the board of directors.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/postmates" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="postmates">Postmates <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> does say that it&#8217;s completing &#8220;millions&#8221; of deliveries every month and is profitable in 90 percent of its markets, and that over the past four years, gross margins have &#8220;improved dramatically to nearly 50%.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the past few months, Postmates <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/10/postmates-adds-another-100-cities-in-the-us/">expanded into more than 100 new cities</a> (it&#8217;s now available in more than 400 U.S. cities, as well as Mexico City) and also announced partnerships with companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/13/instacart-taps-postmates-to-help-with-deliveries-in-sf-during-peak-demand/">Instacart</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/walmart-partners-with-postmates-on-grocery-delivery/">Walmart</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/31/postmates-confirms-140-million-funding-round-at-600-million-valuation/">Postmates previously raised a $140 million round</a> at a $600 million valuation in 2016. More broadly, it looks like VCs aren&#8217;t backing away from the on-demand delivery market — DoorDash, for example, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/16/doordash-4-billion/">raised $250 million at a $4 billion valuation</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The transformation of how commerce moves in cities demands that we build the most innovative tools for businesses to keep up and distribute their products to the modern consumer — efficiently and cost effectively,&#8221; said Postmates CEO Bastian Lehmann in the release. &#8220;Postmates is proud to be the first and largest on-demand network that is enabling the growth of retail across the country, and today&#8217;s investment accelerates our ability to pair technology with the vitality of our neighborhoods.&#8221;</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: We&#39;ve filed charges against <a href="https://twitter.com/facebook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Facebook</a> and 10 employers for using the platform to target their job ads — for positions in male-dominated fields — only to younger men.</p>
<p>Facebook is violating federal civil rights law. Period.</p>
<p>&mdash; ACLU (@ACLU) <a href="https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/1042042609781362689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The 10 employers and employment agency advertisers named in the suit, which the charges allege ran discriminatory jobs in &#8220;mostly&#8221; male-dominated fields, include a police department, multiple retailers, a software development firm and various installation, repair and remodelling companies. (All ten named in the suit are listed in the ACLU&#8217;s <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-and-workers-take-facebook-gender-discrimination-job-ads">press release</a>.)</p>
<p>“I’ve heard stories about when people looked for jobs in the classified ads and big bold letters read ‘help wanted-male’ or ‘help wanted-female.’ I was shocked to find that this discrimination is still happening, just online instead of in newspapers,” said Bobbi Spees, a job-seeker and lead complainant in the case, commenting in a statement.  “I shouldn’t be shut out of the chance to hear about a job opportunity just because I am a woman.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The internet did not erase our civil rights laws.  It violates the law if an employer uses Facebook to deny job ads to women,” added Peter Romer-Friedman, an attorney at Outten &amp; Golden, in another supporting statement. “The last time I checked, you don’t have to be a man to be a truck driver or a police officer.  But Facebook and employers are acting like it’s the 1950s, before federal employment law banned sex discrimination.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The charges allege that Facebook, via its platform, delivers job ads selectively based on age and sex categories that employers expressly choose, and that it earns revenue from placing job ads that exclude women and older workers from receiving the ads.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The ACLU notes that targeting job ads by sex is unlawful under federal, state, and local civil rights laws, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Sex segregated job advertising has historically been used to shut women out of well-paying jobs and economic opportunities,” said Galen Sherwin, senior staff attorney at the ACLU Women’s Rights Project, in another supporting statement. “We can’t let gender-based ad targeting online give new life to a form of discrimination that should have been eradicated long ago.”</p>
<p>While online platforms are not as heavily regulated as publishing platforms the lawsuit argues that Facebook can be held legally responsible for:</p>
<ol>
<li>creating and operating the system that allows and encourages employers to select the gender and age of the people who get their job ads, including providing employers with data on users’ gender and age for targeting purposes;</li>
<li>delivering the gender- and age-based ads based on employers’ preferences; and</li>
<li>acting as a recruiter connecting employers with prospective employees</li>
</ol>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Facebook for comment on the lawsuit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s by no means the first time the company has faced civil rights complaints related to its ad platform.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/28/facebook-ethnic-affinity/">2016</a> ProPublica exposed how Facebook&#8217;s ad tools could be used to exclude users based on their &#8220;ethnic affinity&#8221; &#8212; including in protected categories such as housing, employment and credit opportunities which prohibit discriminatory advertising.</p>
<p>The company responded by saying it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/11/facebook-sort-of-disables-ethnic-affinity-targeting/">build tools</a> to prevent advertisers from applying ethnic affinity targeting in the protected categories. And also by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/08/facebook-updates-its-ad-policies-and-tools-to-protect-against-discriminatory-practices/">rewording its ad policies</a> to more clearly prohibit discrimination.</p>
<p>But the following year another ProPublica investigation showed it was still <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/22/facebooks-ad-system-shown-failing-to-enforce-its-own-anti-discriminatory-policy/">failing to block discriminatory ads</a> &#8212; leaving Facebook to apologize for failing to effectively enforce its own policies (hmmm, now where else have we heard <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/24/kogan-i-dont-think-facebook-has-a-developer-policy-that-is-valid/">the company accused of that&#8230;</a> ), and saying: “Our systems continue to improve but we can do better.”</p>
<p>Last year the company was also shown to have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/20/anticipating-the-dark-side/">allowed ads that included hateful sentiments targeted at Jewish people</a>.</p>
<p>Around about the same time that Facebook was facing renewed criticism over ethnic affinity targeting on its platform being used as a tool for racial discrimination, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/30/facebook-will-temporarily-disable-a-tool-that-lets-advertisers-exclude-people-of-color/">company said</a> it would <em>also</em> take a look at how advertisers are using exclusion targeting across other “sensitive segments” &#8212; such as those relating to members of the LGBTQ community and people with disabilities.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether Facebook included gender-based discrimination in those 2017 self reviews too. (We&#8217;ve asked and will update this post with any response.)</p>
<p>Either way, it appears Facebook has failed to pick up on the potential for gender-based discrimination to be carried out via its ad platform.</p>
<p>And given all the attention its ad tools have attracted lately as a vector for discrimination and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/gallery/here-are-15-of-the-russian-bought-ads-aimed-at-influencing-the-election/">other types of abuse</a> that looks careless to say the least.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s ad platform has faced additional criticism in Europe for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/facebook-faces-fresh-criticism-over-ad-targeting-of-sensitive-interests/">sensitive inferences it makes about users</a> &#8212; given the platform allows advertisers to target people based on political and religious interests, meaning Facebook&#8217;s platform is quietly making sensitive inferences about individuals.</p>
<p>Privacy experts argue this modus operandi entails Facebook processing the sensitive personal data of individuals without explicitly asking people for their upfront consent (as would be required under EU law when you&#8217;re processing sensitive personal data such as political or religious affiliation).</p>
<p>An opinion on a person is still personal data of that person, they contend.</p>
<p>Facebook disagrees, disputing that the inferences its ad platform makes about users (based off of its tracking and data-mining of people) constitutes personal data. But it&#8217;s yet another bone of legal contention now being lobbed at the company.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While the property market in the US appears <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-26/american-housing-market-is-showing-signs-of-running-out-of-steam">headed for a slowdown</a>, a startup that&#8217;s honing in on rentals is doubling down on growth. <a href="http://zumper.com">Zumper</a>, a San Francisco-based startup that has built an end-to-end platform to source, rent out and help service apartments across the US, has raised another $46 million in funding &#8212; money it plans to use to continue enhancing the services it offers to renters and landlords; and to continue its growth nationally.</p>
<p>The funding comes on the back of a strong period of growth for the company, which has around 1 million listings on offer and sees 8 million visitors in an average month, with one-quarter of a million landlords using <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zumper" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zumper">Zumper <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to connect to them. (Zumper doesn&#8217;t disclose revenues, whether it is profitable, or any financials for that matter.)</p>
<p>This Series C was led by media giant <a href="http://axelspringer.com">Axel Springer</a> and growth-stage investor <a href="http://www.stereocap.vc/">Stereo Capital</a>, with participation also from previous investors Dawn Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB), Breyer Capital, Scott Cook, Goodwater Capital and xfund. Zumper has raised $90 million to date. It&#8217;s not revealing its valuation, but a source tells me it&#8217;s more than double its previous valuation, which was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/18/zumper-raises-a-17-6m-series-b-to-expand-beyond-apartment-searches/"> $108 million</a> two years ago. That likely puts it at over $200 million (but probably less than $300 million).</p>
<p>Axel Springer, with its vast experience in media, and specifically publishing and classifieds, is an obvious strategic backer here. But Blackstone, I&#8217;ll note, is a strategic investor of sorts, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a client of Zumper and one of the largest landlords in the US, Blackstone is keenly focused on technological innovation to improve the rental process for both renters and landlords,&#8221; said Sean Muellers of Blackstone who will act as a board observer, in a statement. &#8220;Partnering with the best-in-class Zumper team to effectuate this industry change is the definition of a win-win situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthemos Georgiades, CEO and cofounder of Zumper, says that the company was built in 2014 on the premise that there were already too many portals online that helped people search for apartments, from low-tech but popular sites like Craigslist through to Zillow and a plethora of classified offerings, both local and national.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone had done that already,&#8221; he said of the basic listings business. So instead the startup decided that it would focus on simplifying, speeding up and overall improving the whole process of renting.</p>
<p>As anyone who has rented, or rents out, an apartment knows, search aimed at apartment seekers (and &#8220;lead generation&#8221; for the landlords) is just the beginning of the process. There are many hoops to jump through after that with credit checks, lease signing, moving out of your old place, moving into a new one, and signing up for local services in the new place.</p>
<p>With that in mind, in addition to basic apartment searches, the Zumper platform has been trying to address all of that. It&#8217;s been a gradual progression over the last four years.</p>
<p>Today, Zumper includes a pre-qualification tool that runs credit checks on would-be tenants, and it is also running a beta in which would-be tenants can leave a deposit instantly on a place while touring it to take it off the market. It&#8217;s also in the process of building one tool that will let landlords generate leases to have them signed via Zumper; and another tool so that tenants can also pay rent through the platform.</p>
<p>Further on down the line, Georgiades said that the plan will be to add on more &#8220;transactional&#8221; services to increase its margins further, such as helping tenants sign up for utilities and other services, and perhaps buy or rent things for their apartments.</p>
<p>He said that there are already talks in the works with &#8220;half a dozen&#8221; companies to integrate these kinds of services, but he wouldn&#8217;t say when they would come online. Zumper has partnerships with some big firms like Facebook and Airbnb, respectively to feed in listings to Facebook&#8217;s budding aggregation service; and to take on rentals that extend for periods that Airbnb typically do not cover.</p>
<p>Given that Zumper appears to be happy to have people coming in from different places other than its own site, you can see how building on extra services around core apartment search will be necessarily as a component for developing its business, loyalty and margins.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Zumper&#8217;s focus on taking a different approach to tackling the rental market is not without precedent. Zillow is offering an <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/180731/p25#a180731p25">increasing range</a> of services beyond basic search, and other startups like <a href="http://compass.com">Compass</a> have also focused on how it can provide more than simple listings to would-be tenants to attract top clients on both sides of the marketplace. (Compass, however, puts more of an emphasis on the broker experience.)</p>
<p>Others in Europe like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/23/homelike-airbnblike/">Homelike</a> are also looking at more innovative ways of providing an online platform for renters. And of course Airbnb has been building in many features like Experiences and travel planning to expand its touchpoints with hosts and guests beyond the occasional times that they use the platform for basic property rentals.</p>
<p>Zumper&#8217;s typical and target is a tenant is someone looking for a one-year lease, which it feels has not really been addressed well enough yet in the US.</p>
<p>&#8220;Airbnb has improved the experience in short-term, but no one is doing this in long-term rental,&#8221; Georgiades said.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The goal of any accelerator is to back startups that are reaching exponential growth. Sometimes, though, the accelerator itself hits that inflection point.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techstars.com">Techstars</a>, which was founded in 2006, has expanded aggressively over the past twelve years. Once a single accelerator program for a handful of early-stage startups in Boulder, the program now encompasses 44 separate programs covering six continents and a large number of industry verticals. The firm has hundreds of employees across its headquarters and member programs, and more than 1,600 portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Along the way, the mission of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/techstars" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="techstars">Techstars <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has evolved, from purely accelerating a cohort of startups to championing a culture of “entrepreneurship anywhere.” Co-CEO David Cohen, who co-founded Techstars along with Brad Feld, David Brown, and Jared Polis, said that “Techstars is the worldwide network that helps entrepreneurs succeed,” adding that “the product we are offering is really not an accelerator, but a network.”</p>
<p>The key insight for Techstars was that startups needed to talk to large companies in order to drive sales and ultimately revenues, while at the same time, large companies were looking to talk with startups in order to learn more about innovation and take advantage of it in their operations.</p>
<p>Techstars is looking to intensify that synergy through <a href="https://www.techstars.com/content/accelerators/why-techstars-believes-the-key-to-fortune-500-survival-is-actually-embracing-the-disrupters/">two new programs the company is announcing today</a>. The first is a Network Engagement Program that offers new concierge-style connections for corporations looking to build relationships with startups. The other is a 54-hour Innovation Bootcamp that will teach corporate employees innovation skills in a rapid learning environment with involvement from Techstars alumni.</p>
<p>The larger story here though is how Techstars is increasingly leveraging startups and corporations together to improve both. Techstars runs a number of corporate-backed accelerators with companies like <a href="https://www.techstars.com/programs/barclays-nyc-program/">Barclays</a>, <a href="https://www.techstars.com/programs/rakuten-program">Rakuten</a>, <a href="https://www.techstars.com/programs/metlife-program">MetLife</a>, and <a href="https://www.techstars.com/programs/comcast-program">Comcast NBCU</a>, with each accelerator focusing on areas relevant to their sponsoring companies. Barclays, which has sponsored accelerators in New York City, London, and Tel Aviv, focuses on fintech, for instance.</p>
<p>These companies accrue a number of benefits from the relationship. They get to meet startups that might not have otherwise shown up in their milieu, allowing them to build early relationships. Those early connections can then lead to new purchases and possibly even an investment.</p>
<p>Cohen provided the example of <a href="https://www.sphero.com">Sphero</a>, which launched out of a Disney co-branded Techstars accelerator and <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/12/how-bb-8a-rolling-robot-in-a-galaxy-far-far-awaychanged-everything-for-sphero/">led to the startup’s famed BB-8 product</a>, which drove “$100 million in sales.“ Every company approaches the network differently he said, and “part of the beauty is that they have that choice.” Disney has since <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-la-tech-highlights-20160208-story.html">parted ways with Techstars</a>, however.</p>
<p>Beyond investment and sales growth from corporations, startups can also use their relationships to help with finding an exit when they are ready for one, helping them get through the corporate development gauntlet. Cohen says that “we have an M&amp;A group of 6-7 people” whose full-time job is to maximize the value of a startup’s return.</p>
<p>Beyond these transactional components though, Techstars hopes to change the culture around companies and how they interact with startups. Cohen says that “for our corporations, one of the meta impacts we are learning is how to help them behave better…How to give first to the startup community, versus the classic corporation, how do I take advantage of a startup.”</p>
<p>Obviously, there are a lot of positives when building connections between incumbents and upstarts, but there is also a dark side — challenges around stealthiness and conflicts of interest. After all, some of the startups in Techstars almost certainly want to dislodge the incumbents who may be sponsoring their very program. Cohen even brought this up in the context of the company’s mobility accelerator and the benefits companies receive: “Next time an Uber comes along, Ford isn’t surprised by it.”</p>
<p>Cohen argues against this line of thought in a couple of different ways. First, all decisions are “always up to the startup” and emphasized that “our large company partners don’t have the rights to invest in companies…they don’t have the right to acquire them or frankly do business with them.” Plus, even when co-branded, accelerators are exclusively run by Techstars staff, and the plethora of programs allows startups to avoid potential competitors. “Let’s say you want to go up against Ford, you can still be in the Techstars network, but not in the Ford program,” Cohen explained.</p>
<p>For startup founders, the key ultimately is to be mindful of who they partner with and what information they share with them. That is true as much in Techstars as it is in any other context. As Techstars continues to spread its message of entrepreneurship far and wide in the enterprise world through its new programs, the benefits of closer cooperation — and its attendant downsides — should be thoughtfully evaluated on that well-trodden road to exponential growth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://comcast.com/">Comcast</a> and <a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com/">Ticketmaster</a> are rolling out a feature to let Xfinity X1 customers search tour dates and begin the ticket buying process directly through their televisions &#8212; using <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/support/articles/get-to-know-xr11-remote">voice search on their remotes</a>.</p>
<p>The feature&#8217;s launch coincides with the first tickets going on sale for <a href="https://kellyclarkson.com/Tour">Kelly Clarkson&#8217;s new tour.</a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If users speak &#8220;Kelly Clarkson tour&#8221; into their voice remote, they&#8217;re sent to a dedicated Kelly Clarkson destination (which, surprisingly, isn&#8217;t a purgatory of bland pop power ballads).</p>
<p>To be clear, customers can&#8217;t actually complete an order using the voice tool. Instead they can get set to this destination where they will receive a prompt to buy tickets and then opt in to receive a text with a code that will enable them to buy tickets online.</p>
<p>If that sounds like an incredibly circuitous and unwieldy process to find tickets to concerts nearby for artists someone likes, that&#8217;s because it is.</p>
<p>Customers will see a promotional tile with an option to &#8220;get tickets&#8221; which will let them find a list of performances and corresponding dates at venues &#8212; powered by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ticketmaster" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ticketmaster">Ticketmaster&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> API. Those customers can then opt to receive a text message with a code that they can use to complete the purchase online.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Our team is always thinking of new ways to reach more fans by extending <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ticketmaster" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ticketmaster">Ticketmaster’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> open platform,” said Dan Armstrong, Senior Vice President &amp; General Manager, Distributed Commerce for Ticketmaster in a statement. “This partnership with Comcast is a groundbreaking way to discover events and buy tickets.”</p>
<p>The new feature is certainly groundbreaking. It also seems extremely unnecessary.</p>
<p>For the Kelly Clarkson superfan, the X1 &#8220;experience&#8221; also includes the ability to stream her music through <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pandora" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pandora">Pandora, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> watch music videos, and the singer&#8217;s appearances on <em>The Voice &#8212;</em> as well as watching clips from previous tours and see her web series <em>A Glass of Wine</em>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Fans can now go to Kelly Clarkson’s dedicated destination on X1 to enjoy her music and shop for tickets to her much-anticipated tour right on the TV via this seamless integration with Ticketmaster,” said Nancy Spears,  Vice President, Strategy &amp; Execution at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/comcast" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="comcast">Comcast <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Cable, in a statement. “X1 enables us to unveil new and innovative experiences that complement and elevate content across the plaform and to add more value for customers by giving them more ways to interact with the events, entertainment, performers and brands they love.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.singular.net">Singular</a>, a startup working to unify data for marketers, is announcing that it has raised $30 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>The company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/17/singular-founded-by-ex-onavo-execs-raises-5m-for-its-cross-platform-mobile-marketing-dashboard/">founded by former Onavo executives</a>, including Gadi Eliashiv, Eran Friedman and Susan Kuo — who now serve, respectively, as Singular&#8217;s CEO, CTO and COO.</p>
<p>Eliashiv explained that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/singular-net" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="singular-net">Singular <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was created in response to &#8220;this trend of data explosion in the marketing stack,&#8221; which require marketers to pull data from hundreds or thousands of different systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Essentially what we see is the creation of this new category of marketing intelligence, where the complexity of the marketing stack has created the need for this layer that sits on top,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It doesn’t matter if you use a marketing cloud like Adobe that&#8217;s bundling five products together — at the end of the day, you need a layer on top on making sense of it, helping you make better decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1714936" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Singular_Dashboard.jpg?w=680" alt="Singular Dashboard" width="680" height="398" /></p>
<p>Eliashiv said Singular is able to go from a high-level dashboard summary for CMOs to &#8220;the finest level of detail.&#8221; He also noted that while the company is designed to integrate with existing marketing tools, it will &#8220;oftentimes displace smaller point solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our principal is, it has to be relevant for data, meaning we&#8217;re never going to displace your ad-buying tool,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It’s not what we do. We’re an intelligence platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea of unifying marketing data is one that I hear a lot, but Eliashiv&#8217;s claims seem weightier when you see that Singular is already working with a number of big names, including Lyft, Yelp, Airbnb, LinkedIn, Symantec, Zynga, Match and Twitter.</p>
<p>Singular previously raised $20 million in funding. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/norwest-venture-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="norwest-venture-partners">Norwest Venture Partners <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> led the new round, with partner Scott Beechuk joining the board of directors.</p>
<p>Beechuk told me that he&#8217;d been studying marketing analytics market for quite some time, and he argued, &#8220;There is something really unique and special about Singular. It&#8217;s the bridge between mobile, web and offline, all on a single platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you’re going to find is, there are going to be a lot of technologies that Singular replaces,&#8221; Beechuk continued. &#8220;Let’s say a CMO or [chief growth officer] has 300 different outlets where they are advertising &#8230; Every one of those systems tends to have their own analytics built in. The first thing Singular does, it replaces all of those analytics systems with a single pane of glass.&#8221;</p>
<p>General Catalyst, Method Capital, Telstra Ventures, Translink Capital and Thomvest also participated in the new funding.</p>
