				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://reelgood.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reelgood</a>, a startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/05/reelgoods-app-for-cord-cutters-adds-50-services-personalized-recommendations/">aimed at helping cord cutters</a> find shows and movies to watch on the services they subscribe to, has made an acquisition in the hopes of bringing Reelgood&#8217;s data to more places. The company has bought <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/guidebox">Guidebox</a>, a streaming availability data provider which powers Roku, TVGuide, Metacritic and others.</p>
<p>Deal terms weren&#8217;t disclosed, but we understand the price was in the &#8220;multi millions.&#8221;</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/guidebox" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="guidebox">Guidebox <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> began its life in 2012 as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/22/guidebox/">a consumer-facing website</a> that brought together full show and episode data in one place, then pointed you where you could watch &#8211; very much like today&#8217;s Reelgood, in fact. But over the years, it shifted its focus to working with publishers and device manufacturers. For example, it&#8217;s been well known to be the service that powers Roku&#8217;s universal search feature.</p>
<p>It was most <a href="https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/colortv-guidebox-acquisition-1202390952/">recently reported that Guidebox was sold</a> to video data and recommendation startup ColorTV. However, Reelgood says that deal never actually happened &#8211; the announcement of the acquisition was premature. (ColorTV now appears to be shut down, as it turns out. We&#8217;ve attempted to reach them for confirmation.)</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1737859" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/reelgood-acquires-guidebox.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="410" /></p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/myflicklist-com" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="myflicklist-com">Reelgood <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says it decided to buy Guidebox because it aims to be more than just a guide for streaming TV.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine asking your Alexa, &#8216;Which of my shows has a new episode?&#8217; or reading about a show online and, embedded within the article, seeing where you can watch it,&#8221; the company explains in its announcement about the deal. &#8220;For TV to &#8216;just work,&#8217; we need to make it easier to get Reelgood’s data onto other products, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The need for better organization of streaming services&#8217; content is more critical than ever in today&#8217;s cord cutting era, as consumers increasingly ditch their cable and satellite TV subscriptions to build their own bundles of video services. The average U.S. household now uses four different streaming apps, says Reelgood, and this acquisition will allow it to expand its reach to over 50 million of those households.</p>
<p>The company says it will build on the existing Guidebox technology to make it even easier for companies to help their own users find streaming content. This data will be made available through an API.</p>
<p>That also means that Reelgood isn&#8217;t shutting down Guidebox or ending its existing business relationships &#8211; it aims to expand them, as well as pursue new business opportunities. It&#8217;s currently in the process of renegotiating some of Guidebox&#8217;s deals with larger TV and cable media-centric companies which provide service to some of the bigger networks, we understand.</p>
<p>Guidebox had been working with content providers like Lionsgate, the WWE and Fandor, <a href="https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/colortv-guidebox-acquisition-1202390952/">Variety reported</a> last year.</p>
<p>In terms of the Guidebox team, not all are joining long-term. The executive team is on an earn-out plan, and will help to integrate the technology with Reelgood and transition the client relationships. A few employees working on data  integrity and quality assurance have been hired by Reelgood to help as it expands the product and service.</p>
<p>“No one wants to spend time hunting through apps for the right show,” says David Sanderson, Reelgood founder and CEO, in a statement about the deal. “People expect their devices to help them decide what to watch and where to watch it. Whether it’s a search engine, website, streaming media player, or voice assistant, this is an opportunity for companies to get the experience right.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Move aside <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> China&#8217;s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bytedance" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bytedance">ByteDance <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is now the world&#8217;s highest-valued tech startup.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s according to reports from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2018/10/25/chinas-bytedance-becomes-worlds-largest-internet-startup-after-mega-funding-round/">Forbes</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-26/bytedance-is-said-to-secure-funding-at-record-75-billion-value">Bloomberg</a> both of which claim that the company has completed a $3 billion investment that values the company at $75 billion. A source with knowledge of the deal confirmed the round to TechCrunch and suggested that the value is pre-money, which, adding the round, would put ByteDance&#8217;s valuation at $78 billion. That&#8217;s ahead of Uber&#8217;s most recent $72 billion valuation, although the ride-hailing giant is being tipped to go public next year at <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-proposals-value-company-at-120-billion-in-a-possible-ipo-1539690343">a valuation of up to $120 billion</a>.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bytedance" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bytedance">ByteDance <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/08/bytedance-is-raising-2-5b-3b/">We previously reported</a> that ByteDance was in talks with KKR and General Atlantic, and they were joined by SoftBank in the round &#8212; with Bloomberg reporting <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/softbank" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="softbank">SoftBank <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> plans to put in a total of around $1.8 billion which will include buying out some existing investors via secondary sales. On that note, the publication also claims that the round remains open to additional investors so the amount raised could increase.</p>
<p>ByteDance operates a range of digital media platforms, but it is best known for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/toutiao" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="toutiao">Toutiao, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> its AI-based news aggregator that has become one of China&#8217;s most-used apps with over 120 million users, and short video platform <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/musical-ly" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="musical-ly">TikTok, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/02/musically-tiktok/">recently gobbled up Music.ly</a> which ByteDance acquired via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/09/chinas-toutiao-is-buying-musical-ly-in-a-deal-worth-800m-1b/">a $1 billion acquisition</a> last year.</p>
<p>But it isn&#8217;t just popular in China. That TikTok-Music.ly merger is aimed at growing the platform globally, while ByteDance operates a number of Toutiao-like global services too. It has carefully fenced its Chinese and international versions, though. TikTok (500 million monthly users) and Chinese equivalent Douyin (300 million MAUs) are restricted to their respective markets, principally due to censorship concerns.</p>

<p>ByteDance has done the impossible and become an internet giant in China, breaking the dominance of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/baidu" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="baidu">Baidu, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Alibaba and Tencent &#8212; the so-called BAT big three &#8212; but U.S. giants are also paying attention. Because imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is said to be (controversially) developing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/google-censored-news-app-for-china/">a Toutiao-like news app for China</a>, while TechCrunch reportedly this week that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/facebook-musically-competitor/">Facebook is hatching a TikTok clone</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/02/bytedance-enters-2018-with-some-uncertainty/">It hasn&#8217;t been plain sailing</a>, though. ByteDance has been reprimanded by the Chinese government which has seen its services given app store bans, and the company&#8217;s content moderation team grown from 6,000 to 10,000. That&#8217;s part of the growing pains and in many ways, interest from Beijing is definitely a compliment that shows just how influential the company has become.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/13/the-chat-fiction-apps-that-teens-go-crazy-for/">Chat fiction startups</a> have been exploring the types of stories that you can tell in the form text message conversations, and now <a href="http://www.hooked.co">Hooked</a> is taking that exploration one step further with the launch of &#8220;Dark Matter.&#8221; The company describes this as its first feature-length story.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dark Matter&#8221; tells the story of Tasneem (Taz) Singh, a South Asian American student at Stanford who, after the mysterious death of her twin sister, discovers that she has the ability to interact with the paranormal.</p>
<p>The story debuts today on Snapchat, with a new chapter coming out every day until Tuesday, October 30. According to CEO Prerna Gupta, the full script totals 32,000 words — in other words, it&#8217;s the length of a feature film script or short novel: &#8220;I think it’s fair to say this is the longest chat fiction story. It&#8217;s certainly the longest one we&#8217;ve ever produced for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hooked" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hooked">Hooked <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not already a chat fiction fan, you may be skeptical about reading something that long in text message format. Gupta admitted that she and her husband Parag Chordia had similar doubts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/17/hooked/">when they started the company together</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would be lying if I didn’t say if we also didn’t have that question ourselves,&#8221; she told me. &#8220;When a new kind of format or really new medium comes up, you start with the basics first. You tell the simplest stories, then as you become more adept at communicating with that format, you can start to go deeper.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s meant going beyond text — &#8220;Dark Matter,&#8221; for example, will include a voice track and custom illustrations.</p>
<p><img class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-1737889" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/darkmatter-excerpt-2.png?w=383" alt="Dark Matter excerpt" width="383" height="680" /></p>
<p>&#8220;The length makes a big difference,&#8221; Gupta added. &#8220;You can take your time, slow it down and spend more time with world, developing deeper relationships between the characters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dark Matter&#8221; was written by Hooked staff writer Elyse Endick, but Gupta said the writing process was &#8220;almost more like a writers room — it was very collaborative, she did a show bible, then at each step she and I and our head of content would sit in a Google Hangout and just kind of flesh it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the story is premiering on Snapchat, it will also make its way to the main Hooked app, which has 40 million monthly active users. Gupta said that she&#8217;s less focused on owning the distribution channel than on reaching big, global audiences — and distributing via Snapchat can help with that. (The company says 100 million unique readers have accessed its stories across the Hooked app and Snapchat.)</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m not trying to be the next Instagram,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It’s not about the app or any given app. For me, it’s really about our stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while Snapchat has recently lost some of its luster (daily active user count fell by another 1 percent in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/snapchat-q3-2018-earnings/">its most recent quarter</a>), Gupta said, &#8220;I think people are underestimating their whole strategy around entertainment, around being TV for the next generation.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added that engagement around Hooked content on Snapchat has been &#8220;insane.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are we investing our resources with Snap? Because of what we’re seeing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Our audience and how engaged they are, that’s real.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/makespace-startup-ceo-change/">MakeSpace founder and former CEO Samuel Rosen</a> is ready to launch his next venture, and it has little or nothing to do with the on-demand economy. This time, Rosen is setting his sights on the world of water.</p>
<p><a href="https://findtap.com/">Tap</a> aims to be the world&#8217;s first public index and global search engine for drinking water.</p>
<p>Plastic water bottles are, in many ways, the scourge of the planet. More than 90 percent of the environmental impact of plastic water bottles happens during manufacture, and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/28/a-million-a-minute-worlds-plastic-bottle-binge-as-dangerous-as-climate-change#comments">Guardian reported</a> that more than 1 million plastic water bottles were sold a minute across the globe in 2016.</p>
<p><img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/eeLpp0rQ.png?w=382" alt="" width="382" height="680" class="vertical alignleft size-large wp-image-1737850" />Some people have switched over to reusable water bottles and canteens, but once they do, there is no way to search for water fountains or sources of drinking water. That&#8217;s where Tap comes in.</p>
<p>In its first iteration, Tap is a bit like the Waze for water. Using a combination of user-generated content and data from water fountain manufacturers, Tap aims to be a public search engine for where to find water. As it stands now, Tap has more than 34,000 Refill Stations across 30 countries indexed on the app.</p>
<p>But Tap also has ambitions to offer a backend system for water fountain companies. Normally, these companies sell a number of units to airports or other commercial or government properties. Those customers then install the fountains wherever they see fit, and the water fountain company is more or less uninvolved.</p>
<p>However, those companies then need to maintain the fountains, installing new filters and repairing broken parts, etc. But one fountain may be far more trafficked than another, and thus need higher frequency maintenance.</p>
<p>Tap wants to offer an SDK to these companies so that when users report bad filters or a broken water fountain, that information shows up on their dashboard.</p>
<p>Rosen sees an opportunity to generate revenue in a manner similar to Google, offering an advertising product for companies down the line.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/home">Epic Games</a>, the creators of the runaway gaming smash hit Fortnite, have raised $1.25 billion in a new round of financing.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been 20 years since <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/epic-games-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="epic-games-2">Epic Games <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> first released its Unreal game development engine in concert with its first person shooter, Unreal. Since then, the company has been releasing free-to-play games as a loss leader to show off what its powerful development toolkit can do.</p>
<p>Now, with the insane success of Fortnite, the company has flipped the script.</p>
<p>Since Fortnite became the thing that nearly every gamer in the world plays, the company has slashed prices on the Unreal game engine <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/fortnite-maker-epic-games-beefs-up-its-unreal-game-engine-in-new-update/">even as it keeps upgrading the technology</a>.</p>

<p>And the company has been plowing that cash back into the community to support esports tournaments with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/21/epic-games-will-pump-100-million-into-fortnite-esports-competitions/">$100 million prize pool</a> to support competitive Fortnite gamers.</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s game has become the kind of old-school cultural phenomenon that one rarely sees in the fractured age of internet silos. It&#8217;s inspired dance crazes, Halloween costumes, and even<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/10/fortnite-monopoly-and-nerf-blasters-are-coming-soon/"> a Monopoly game and a Nerf gun</a>.</p>

<p>And now it appears that the game has also inspired some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley&#8217;s venture capital investment scene to commit huge sums to continue its success.</p>
<p>Investors in the latest round include KKR, Iconiq Capital, Smash Ventures,<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/vulcan-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="vulcan-capital">Vulcan Capital, Kleiner <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Perkins and <a href="https://lsvp.com/">Lightspeed Venture Partners</a>, as well as gaming companies like aXiomatic, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/nba-all-star-michael-jordan-leads-a-26-million-round-for-esports-group-axiomatic/">announced a significant investment from the NBA legend Michael Jordan</a> earlier in October.</p>
<p>The new investors are joining Tencent, Disney, and Endeavor as minority shareholders in the company &#8212; which amazingly still is controlled by its chief executive and founder, Tim Sweeney.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/epic-games-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="epic-games-2">Epic Games <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has fundamentally changed the model for interactive entertainment under the company&#8217;s visionary leadership,&#8221; said Ted Oberwager of KKR, in a statement.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blockchain startup <a href="https://www.blockchain.com">Blockchain</a> shared its <a href="https://blog.blockchain.com/2018/10/25/new-ways-to-control-your-crypto/">roadmap</a> for the coming months. The company is launching a hardware wallet in partnership <a href="https://www.ledger.fr/2018/10/25/blockchain-announces-exclusive-hardware-wallet-lockbox-powered-by-ledger/">with Ledger</a>. Blockchain is also launching a new trading platform called Swap — this platform will find the best trading prices across a variety of exchanges and liquidity pools so that you can exchange tokens at a fair price straight from your Blockchain account.</p>
<p>Blockchain is one of the most successful cryptocurrency wallets out there. The company has built a solid user base with a software wallet for Bitcoin, and now also Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash.</p>
<p>Compared to traditional exchanges, you remain in control of your private keys. Blockchain can’t access your tokens, hackers can’t empty your wallet if Blockchain gets hacked. Blockchain currently manages 30 million wallets, which represent over $200 billion in transaction volume in the last two years.</p>
<p>But a software wallet isn’t as secure as a hardware wallet. There have been countless of phishing attempts and scams to take over your private keys. That’s why Blockchain is going to release its own hardware wallet, sort of.</p>
<p>The company is partnering with French startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ledger-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ledger-2">Ledger <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to release the <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/lockbox">Blockchain Lockbox</a>. It looks exactly like the Ledger Nano S, but with a Blockchain logo. It’ll feature a customer Blockchain firmware and integrate with Blockchain’s wallets.</p>
<p>Just like Ledger’s own app, you’ll be able to check your balance without connecting your hardware wallet to a computer. But as soon as you want to process a transaction, you’ll need to plug your Ledger wallet to confirm the transaction on the device itself.</p>
<p>It’ll be interesting to see how your Blockchain wallet and the one tied to your Blockchain Lockbox work together. The Lockbox could act as a sort of longterm vault while you could keep some coins on your standard Blockchain wallet for frequent transactions.</p>
<p>As for Swap, Blockchain is building its own trading product. It’s not going to be a separate exchange as the company plans to integrate with multiple sources. Eventually, Blockchain hopes to add support for decentralized exchange protocols so that you can exchange tokens without going through an exchange.</p>
<p>The Blockchain Lockbox will cost $99 and start shipping in November. I hope there will be other versions that support Bluetooth and mobile phones in the future as Blockchain is quite popular on mobile.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thrills? Chills? iPads? Definitely yes on that last one, at least. The invites are out and the rumors have been pouring in, fast and furious. On <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/18/apples-holding-another-big-event-october-30/">Tuesday October 30</a>, the company will be wrapping up hardware season with one final event, hitting all of the points that didn’t quite make it into September’s big iPhone event. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As ever, the company’s attempting to keep a tight seal on the news, but we’ve got plenty of clues to work from here. For starters, there’s the fact that the “special event” is being held at the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Howard Gilman Opera House. It’s a cool space. I saw Jeff Mangum do a bunch of shows there, NBD. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Also, the company customized dozens (hundreds?) of designs for the event, sending out customized invites to everyone on its list. Thanks Apple! You really know how to make a tech blogger special. The through line, however, was the tag line, “There&#8217;s More in the Making.” All of which implies that the company is once again turning the camera back on creative pros. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That certainly comports with the rumors we’ve heard thus far, which largely focus on the iPad Pro and a slew of new MacBooks. So let’s start with the easy one. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A new iPad Pro is all but a given at this point. The device is expected to get a pretty thorough makeover, starting with some key design changes. The biggest news on that front borrows some cues from the last couple of iPhones, dramatically reducing the bezels on all sides (while keeping them present so there’s a place to put your hands). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s thanks, in part, to the elimination of the home bottom, a rumored change that would also anticipate the arrival of Face ID to unlock the handset. Inside, the device is expected to get the new A12 chip, which debuted on the iPhone XS. An update to the Pencil also appears to be in the works? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the entry-level iPad was refreshed at an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/apple-introduces-a-cheap-9-7-inch-ipad-with-apple-pencil-support/"> education event in Chicago</a> this year, rumors of an iPad Mini 5 have been floated by human Apple crystal ball, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/23/kuo-predicts-new-ipad-mini-5-airpower-launch-in-late-2018-or-early-2019-more/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kuo also predicts, get this, the long-awaited arrival of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/12/where-the-heck-is-apples-airpower-wireless-charging-mat/">AirPower</a>. Apple’s three-in-one iPhone/Watch/AirPod charging pad has been MIA since the company debuted it at WWDC of LAST YEAR. The mat is reported to finally be hitting later this year or early next, along with new AirPods. Among other things, the update to the popular Bluetooth earbuds will sport a new case with, naturally, wireless charging and a color indicator on the outside. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And then there are the Macs. Rumors have up to four new Apple computers hitting the stage on the 30th. The Mac Mini and iMac are the frontrunners here, along with the even longer-awaited MacBook Air refresh, sporting a Retina Display, priced at below the standard MacBook.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> And for good measure, how about an update on the Mac Pro? Last we heard, it’s coming next year. So why not feature it as a “one more thing” at this creative pro-focused event? The event kicks off Tuesday October 30, at 10AM ET. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a clever bit of sleuthing by <a href="https://breakermag.com/we-asked-crypto-news-outlets-if-theyd-take-money-to-cover-a-project-more-than-half-said-yes/">Corin Faife at Breaker</a>, we find that over half of the most popular crypto blogs offer pay-for-play posts including &#8220;CEO interviews&#8221; that are not labelled as sponsored. Further, many sites offer premium services in which blog writers will repost PR content without a sponsored tag.</p>
<p>As I noted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/18/inside-the-pay-for-post-ico-industry/">a few weeks ago</a>, the crypto industry is awash with money and &#8220;journalists&#8221; are taking advantage of the naivety and dishonesty of the marketers tasked with pushing another me-too crypto product in front of an unreceptive audience. Faife received multiple emails like this one asking him to accept payment for placing articles at the places he worked, including Motherboard and Coindesk:</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1737833" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Bribe_offer_2.png" alt="" width="506" height="316" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I know that I would never take money for coverage, nor would any serious journalist. But covering the cryptocurrency industry, I read content on a daily basis that comes from a large number of outlets that I can’t vouch for. If these offers of pay-for-post are out there, can we rely on all of the journalists and editors to turn them down? Can we believe in the objectivity of the coverage we see every day, or has it simply been paid for by a company flush with cash?&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;The more I thought about it, the more it seemed like there was a simple way to find out. As a BREAKER investigation, we’d ask to pay for coverage of an ICO, and see who said yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Faife reached out to 28 cryptocurrency news sites and received 22 definitive responses. Posing as a Russian PR professional, Faife first asked for rates for posting information on the site. When he received a response, he asked if the posts would have a &#8220;sponsored&#8221; tag, a traditional signal that a post wasn&#8217;t explicitly written by the news organization&#8217;s reporters.</p>
<p>Of the 22 replies, he received 14 agreeable responses including an offer to remove the sponsored tag for $4,500. This helpful graph shows how quickly sites will abandon journalistic ethics to grab a little cash:</p>
<p><img class="breakout size-full wp-image-1737836 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Payola_index_corrected.png" alt="" width="1024" height="540" /></p>
<p>One site, NewsBTC, responded to Faife when pressed about payola:</p>
<blockquote><p>Contacted about the story, Samuel Rae, CEO of NewsBTC, responded:</p>
<p>“It’s come to my attention that one of our sales team has mistakenly suggested that we could publish content without disclosure that it has been paid for (i.e. a sponsored article) to one of your undercover reporters posing as a PR agent. This is not our policy. The sales executive offering this has been removed from our company active immediately and won’t be dealing with/offering our advertising (or otherwise) services again, be it to a PR company, a reseller or anyone else.”</p>
<p>Pressed to offer evidence that the staff member had been removed, and to explain a second source quoting NewsBTC’s willingness to publish sponsored content without disclosure, Rae declined to give further comment.</p></blockquote>
<p>The important thing to note here are the sums of money that many of these crypto and ICO organizations will raise thanks to a small investment in media. A solid blog post can move untrained &#8220;investors&#8221; to buy or sell crypto and tokens in an instant, creating situations ripe for pump and dump schemes where the actual level of interest in a company is clouded by payola. Most sane, mature news organizations see this problem and address it by refusing to accept paid content. That said, times are changing and the lines are blurring between paid and unpaid content. Ultimately, however, the behavior Faife uncovered is implicitly wrong.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an old saying: fools and their money are soon parted. Uneducated and uninformed crypto investors are fools, but they visit crypto sites for a proper education. When news organizations create so-called fake news in order to drum up a little advertising cash, everyone loses.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Samsung’s foldable phone has been floating around the company under the codename “Winner” for some time now. That bit of info isn’t new. It’s understandably taken the company a while to get the thing just right. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After all, we’re talking a new paradigm here in terms of form factor. It’s an exciting process, indeed — and a code a LOT of companies have been trying to crack. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-26/inside-samsung-s-bid-to-challenge-apple-with-5g-folding-phones">a new report from Bloomberg</a>, however, some of the heel dragging with regard to decision making on that front is really coming down to the wire here. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Samsung Developer Conference, happening next month in San Francisco, could be the big debut for the long-awaited product. From the sound of the report, however, we’re going to see little more than a “conceptual image” of the product, rather than a retail device or even prototype. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That means, of course, that we can probably rule out any possibility that the company is going to attempt to jam this thing out for the holidays. The unveil would be more of a check in to let the world know that the product is, indeed, still in the works, and big innovation is just around the corner. Winners don’t just happen overnight, you know. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Screen orientation is reportedly a sticking point here, with the company ultimately opting for a design that opens like an old school flip phone. Samsung is said to be working with Google on a custom version of Android that can handle the new design language — similar to what LG did with Android wear on its new hybrid watch. There are also some concerns around mass production. The phrase “The screen, when it cracks, shatters like dried paper” doesn’t really instill a lot of confidence here. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As reported earlier, Samsung’s next flagship, the S10 will sport an in-screen fingerprint reader (a similar feature is also coming on the soon to launch OnePlus 6T). More surprisingly, the company is also “toying” with dropping the headphone jack on the device. While it’s true the decision feels like an inevitability, Samsung has roundly mocked Apple’s decision for years now. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is making it easier to use Alexa to do more than launch apps and streaming services on Fire TV devices, but to also navigate once inside them. The company confirmed it quietly launched an update specifically for Fire TV Cube devices that allows device owners to use Alexa instead of a remote control for doing things like making profile selections, moving up and down or left and right, as well as selecting items.</p>
<p>In other words, Fire TV Cube owners can now use Alexa to navigate their Fire TV, with no remote control required.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The feature began its rollout a few weeks ago, the company told TechCrunch, but reached all Fire TV Cube devices around a week ago. </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="http://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-fire-tv-cube-gains-hands-free-voice-navigation-in-netflix-and-other-3rd-party-apps/">AFTVNews</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> was the first spot the new navigation option in the wild. </span></p>
<p>According to Amazon, the decision to enable Alexa to take place of a remote control was based on customer feedback.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got a deeper understanding that customers want the ability to use their voice to select, browse and navigate through their favorite apps, just like they can on the Fire TV home screen,&#8221; a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>To use the feature inside an app, you can say things like &#8220;Alexa, go up,&#8221; &#8220;Alexa, move right,&#8221; or &#8220;Alexa, scroll down,&#8221; then pick what you want to watch by saying &#8220;Alexa, select&#8221; (or &#8220;select this&#8221; or &#8220;select that.&#8221;)</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of it like a d-pad for you voice,&#8221; the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>The voice navigation is already supported across a range of apps, including Hulu, Netflix, ESPN, HBO Go, HBO Now, FOX Now, FXNow, ABC, FilmStruck, Boomerang, Tubi TV, Red Bull TV, Cartoon Network, Hallmark Movies Now, DramaFever, The CW, and CW Seed, with more being added regularly.</p>
<p>While it could be a bit awkward to use Alexa to browse through many screens of content &#8211; the way you do when in search of something to watch &#8211; if you&#8217;re just moving down a couple of rows to resume a show on Netflix, for example, it&#8217;s less of a bother.</p>
<p>The feature could also be useful from an accessibility standpoint, as it provides a way to navigate through the Fire TV interface without having to grip a remote and use your fingers and/or thumb to press buttons. And it could help users with low vision, who have trouble seeing the correct buttons on the remote.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the new voice navigation is a Fire TV Cube-only feature for now. The feature was enabled on Fire TV devices over the past few weeks, but a software update began to roll out on October 19 which includes an explanation to end users, so they&#8217;re aware of the new functionality. Amazon didn&#8217;t say if or when it would arrive on other Fire TV platforms.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After getting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/19/microsofts-7-5bn-github-buy-gets-green-lit-by-eu-regulators/">EU approval a week ago</a>, today Microsoft&#8217;s acquisition of GitHub, the Git-based code sharing and collaboration service with 31 million developers, has <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/10/26/microsoft-completes-github-acquisition/">officially closed</a>. The Redmond, WA-based software behemoth first said it would acquire GitHub for $7.5 billion in stock <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-has-acquired-github-for-7-5b-in-microsoft-stock/">in June of this year</a>, and after the acquisition closed it would continue to run it as an independent platform and business.</p>
<p>The acquisition is yet another sign of how <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has been doubling down on courting developers and presenting itself as a neutral partner to help them with their projects.</p>
<p>That is because, despite its own very profitable proprietary software business, Microsoft also has a number of other businesses &#8212; for example, Azure, which competes with AWS and Google Cloud &#8212; that rely heavily on it being unbiased towards one platform or another. And <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/github" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="github">GitHub, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Microsoft hopes, will be another signal to the community of that position.</p>
<p>In that regard, it will be an interesting credibility test for the companies.</p>
<p>As previously announced, Nat Friedman, who had been the CEO of Xamarin (another developer-focused startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/24/microsoft-is-buying-mobile-cross-platform-development-company-xamarin/">acquired by Microsoft</a>, in 2016), will be CEO of the company, while GitHub founder and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2017/08/17/github-ceo-chris-wanstrath-to-step-down/#40ff771c9ead">former CEO</a> Chris Wanstrath will become a Microsoft technical fellow to work on strategic software initiatives. (Wanstrath had come back to his CEO role after his co-founder Tom Preston-Werner resigned following a <a href="https://blog.github.com/2014-04-21-results-of-the-github-investigation/">harassment investigation</a> in 2014.)</p>
<p>Friedman, in a <a href="https://blog.github.com/2018-10-26-github-and-microsoft/">short note</a>, said that he will be taking over on Monday, and he also repeated what Microsoft said at the time of the deal: GitHub will be run as an independent platform and business.</p>
<p>This is a key point because there has been a lot of developer backlash over the deal, with many asking if GitHub would become partial or focused more around Microsoft-based projects  or products.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will always support developers in their choice of any language, license, tool, platform, or cloud,&#8221; he writes, noting that there will be more tools to come. &#8220;We will continue to build tasteful, snappy, polished tools that developers love,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>One of those, he noted, will be further development and investment in <a href="https://blog.github.com/2018-08-28-announcing-paper-cuts/">Paper Cuts</a>, a project it launched in August that it hopes will help address some of the gripes that its developer-users might have with how GitHub works that the company itself hadn&#8217;t been planning to address in bigger product upgrades. The idea here is that GitHub can either help find workarounds, or this will become a feedback forum of its own to help figure out what it should be upgrading next on the site.</p>
<p>Of course, the need to remain neutral is not just to keep hold of its 31 million developers (up by 3 million since the deal was first announced), but to keep them from jumping to GitHub competitors, which include GitLab and Bitbucket.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780?mt=2">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. This week the normal band was together, with <a href="http://twitter.com/cookie">Connie Loizos</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Danny Crichton</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">myself</a> on hand along with <a href="https://www.ivp.com/team/jules-maltz/">IVP investor Jules Maltz</a>.</p>
<p>We had yet another <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/a-little-blip-correction-territory-and-fear/">episode of market turmoil</a>, that was again reversed to some extent before we could even talk about it. Our questions are somewhat simple: when does all this public market mayhem begin to impact private markets? Maltz isn&#8217;t worried yet, but we wondered not only about what level of upheaval is enough to change things, but also how we&#8217;d be able to tell when things were changing.</p>
<p>But, in keeping with recent news, the venture world is still blasting along. This week we talked about three different billion-dollar-plus rounds, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/23/josh-kushners-thrive-capital-brings-in-1b/">Thrive Capital fund</a> (historical chart <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/joshua-kushners-thrive-capital-raises-1b-amid-questions-about-brothers-ties-to-saudi-arabia/">here</a>), that tips the scale at $1 billion;</li>
<li>A new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/bessemer-venture-partners-has-a-brand-new-1-85b-fund/">Bessemer fund</a> (historical chart <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/bessemer-venture-partners-raises-1-85b-for-fund-x-its-largest-yet/">here</a>) that weighs in at $1.85 billion;</li>
<li>And a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/looks-like-tiger-global-management-just-closed-the-second-biggest-venture-fund-this-year/">new vehicle from Tiger Global</a> (historical chart <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/how-tiger-globals-new-3-8b-fund-stacks-up-to-its-prior-funds/">here</a>) that covers a full $3.75 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of new money charging into tech. If there&#8217;s going to be a downturn any time soon, it&#8217;s going to be a downturn that can afford a Bently. At least if the venture world keeps writing checks.</p>
<p>But not everything was doom, gloom and new cash. Yes, we had an IPO to go over. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/qualtrics">Qualtrics</a>, one of the lesser-known but highest-quality companies out of the Utah scene is going public, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/qualtrics-files-to-take-its-survey-and-satisfaction-tracking-business-public/">and we like what we see</a>.</p>
<p>How does solid revenue growth in the nine-figure range, effectively break-even GAAP profits, and strong cash flow sound? We&#8217;re guessing it&#8217;s going to sound pretty good to public market investors who have paid top dollar recently for tech IPOs that seem to be of, if we may, lesser quality.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/whatsapp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="whatsapp">WhatsApp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is finally adding stickers to its hugely popular messaging app. <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/10000653/Introducing-Stickers">The company said today</a> that support for stickers will roll out to Android and iOS users over &#8220;the coming weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/31/whatsapp-hits-1-5-billion-monthly-users-19b-not-so-bad/">the app&#8217;s 1.5 billion users</a> will have a seemingly limited selection with the first packs provided by WhatsApp&#8217;s own design team and some &#8220;other artists&#8221; chosen by the company.</p>
<p>However, that&#8217;s likely to change in the future since <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/whatsapp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="whatsapp">WhatsApp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will allow anyone to add stickers that can be used inside the app.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s taking an interesting route to enabling that. Would-be sticker artists will need to publish their packs as an app on the Google Play or Apple App Store. From there, users can download the apps and then make use of the packs inside WhatsApp. The company has provided a template that it claims requires &#8220;minimal development or coding experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>A full guide on the sticker submission process can be found <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/26000226">here</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1737779" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/whatsapp-stickers.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="425" /></p>
<p>Other messaging apps have taken a different approach.</p>
<p>Line &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/10/creepy-cute-line/">which pioneered the concept of stickers</a> &#8212; takes a very curated approach, with sticker packs approved by the company itself. That walled garden approach has helped it curate the best selection of stickers, many of which are paid. That&#8217;s nothing to be scoffed as since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/13/chat-app-line-makes-over-270-million-a-year-from-selling-stickers/">Line makes hundreds of millions of dollars</a> from sticker purchases every year.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/telegram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="telegram">Telegram <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has the most open sticker platform. Anyone can make and publish stickers in just minutes, but that leads to its own problems such as plagiarism and differing levels of quality.</p>
<p>Either way, WhatsApp&#8217;s move into stickers is very much a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-led move.</p>
<p>The service&#8217;s founders &#8212; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/jan-koum" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="jan-koum">Jan Koum <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/brian-acton" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="brian-acton">Brian Acton <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> &#8212; have both left the social network under controversial terms, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2018/09/26/exclusive-whatsapp-cofounder-brian-acton-gives-the-inside-story-on-deletefacebook-and-why-he-left-850-million-behind/">at least according to Acton himself</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to the acquisition deal, both men were <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/245/Why-we-dont-sell-ads">very vocally opposed to advertising</a>, games and other functions. They deemed them trivial and believed that they detracted from the core focus of WhatsApp: simple and fast messaging.</p>
<p>At this point, their ethical ship has long since sailed with Facebook introducing features like a business service and ad integrations with Facebook, while there are plans to roll out payments and other features that Koum and Acton would no doubt have railed against. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2018/09/26/exclusive-whatsapp-cofounder-brian-acton-gives-the-inside-story-on-deletefacebook-and-why-he-left-850-million-behind/#28a3ec643f20">It&#8217;s enough to make you vomit over the side of your yacht in the Mediterranean</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We couldn’t put together <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-berlin-2018/" title="TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin">a conference in Berlin</a> without inviting <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/valentin-stalf">Valentin Stalf</a> from <a href="https://n26.com/" title="N26">N26</a>, the co-founder and CEO of one of Europe&#39;s most promising startups.</p>
<p>A few years ago, few people would have bet on a startup creating a bank from scratch. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/n26" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="n26">N26 <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> now has over 1.5 million clients and a ton of funding.</p>
<p>N26 originally launched at TechCrunch Disrupt London back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/20/number26-is-a-bank-designed-for-the-21st-century/">2014</a>. The company didn&#39;t win the Startup Battlefield. At the time, the company was called Number26 and they had 0 client. It was probably too early and too risky for our panel of judges. But we wanted to bet on them and give them some stage time.</p>
<p>I’ve covered N26 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/n26/">relentlessly</a> over the years. They let me test the product back when everything was in German. They’re now available all around Europe (including the U.K.). And it always feels great when Startup Battlefield companies graduate and come back to Disrupt as regular speakers.</p>
<p>But N26 also faces a lot of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/17/n26-faces-criticism-regarding-its-identification-processes/" title="N26 faces criticism regarding its identification processes">scrutiny</a> — all eyes are on that young company that wants to manage your money. N26 isn’t the only challenger bank either. It’s still fine for now as they’re all converting customers from traditional banks. But at some point, they’ll compete directly with each other.</p>
<p>Up next, N26 wants to expand to the U.S. It’s an interesting market as it’s highly fragmented with inconsistent regulation across all 50 states. And let’s be honest, American banks suck. They’re riddle with fees and a bad customer experience.</p>
<p>If you want to hear how Stalf plans to go to the next level, come to Disrupt Berlin. The conference will take place on November 29-30 and you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-berlin-2018/tickets" title="buy your ticket right now">buy your ticket right now</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to fireside chats and panels, like this one, new startups will participate in the Startup Battlefield Europe to win the highly coveted Battlefield cup.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Innovusion, a two-year-old startup developing LiDAR sensor technology for autonomous vehicles, has raised $30 million in a Series A funding round co-led by Chinese firms Nio Capital and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/eight-roads-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="eight-roads-ventures">Eight Roads Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> along with U.S.-based F-Prime Capital.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other seed round and strategic investors joined the round, the startup said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nio Capital is the venture arm of Nio, the Chinese electric automaker aiming to compete with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla</a>. Nio, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/13/nio-makes-bumpy-start/">raised $1 billion</a> when it debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in September, has operations in the U.S., U.K. and Germany, although it only sells its ES8 vehicle in China.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Innovusion, which was founded in November 2016, says it will use the funding to scale up its operations, specifically to ramp up production of its light detection and ranging sensor system called Innovusion Cheetah. The company began shipping samples of the system in the second quarter of 2018 and is beginning to take customer orders.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The round of funding will allow the Los Altos, California-based company to expand its R&amp;D team and manufacturing facilities to more quickly develop, market and deliver Innovusion Cheetah <span class="il">LiDAR</span> to customers around the world, according to Junwei Bao, the company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO. The company primarily is targeting customers in China and the U.S.</p>
<p dir="ltr">LiDAR is used by companies developing autonomous vehicles to detect and measure objects on the road around them. Most of the companies testing AVs believe LiDAR is an essential sensor required to deploy self-driving vehicles safely on public roads. It&#8217;s what has propelled demand for LiDAR and, in turn, an array of startups to pop up and try capture market share away from Velodyne, the long-time dominant leader in the space.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The promise of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tether" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tether">Tether, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the digital currency pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, was that it could provide the benefits of a cryptocurrency while providing a fiat -backed peg against price fluctuations.</p>
<p>But the currency has fallen below the $1 in recent weeks, right as a range of competing currencies are becoming available to meet the growing interest in the so-called “stablecoin” sector. It’s certainly not a coincidence.</p>
<p>Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to a stable asset, such as gold or fiat currencies, or backed by collateral (that could also be a cryptocurrency), or even an algorithm that governs the approach to expanding and contracting the money supply. The goal of every stablecoin project is to achieve the scale and adoption of modern monetary systems, as a store of value and also as a medium of exchange.</p>
<p>As we see Tether decline in adoption, opportunities arise for a number of new exchange stablecoins to become the go-to-coin. At the moment, we are seeing a commoditization of the space, and it won’t be until when trading volumes picks back up again when a new (or perhaps the same) Tether arises.</p>
<h2>What’s been going on with Tether lately?</h2>
<p>Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin to date, seems to be in a terminal decline following intense scrutiny this year over dubious accounting practices. USDT is a widely tradable stablecoin created by Tether, a company run by the same executives behind the exchange BitFinex. <a href="https://tether.to/">Tether</a> has been <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tether-review-claims-crypto-asset-fully-backed-theres-catch/">criticized</a> for its failure to prove that the reserve has enough US dollar to back its digital currency on a one-to-one ratio, which it promises for its dollar-pegged cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The pro-USDT narrative has been that despite its failure to provide transparency into its reserves and failing to acquire a proper audit, USDT is still the most widely traded stablecoin with significantly more volume than other stablecoin competitors. It previously compromised over 90% of market cap of all stablecoins and was listed on the most exchanges than any other stablecoin.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, that narrative seems to be breaking in the last 2 weeks. USDT has since seen its market cap <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/">go down by almost a third</a>, from its peak of $2.8 billion to $2 billion in the course of 2 months.</p>
<p>In the past, users would purchase USDT via the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bitfinex" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bitfinex">Bitfinex <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> platform for two major reasons, which is to buy bitcoin or transfer USD between countries. Given these two major applications, USDT has attracted users both outside and inside the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
<p>Recently, TechCrunch has gathered from investors that believe the price gap developed between Tether and USD is concerning. Because in the traditional markets, one would expect that big players and market makers would be capitalizing on that opportunity and closing the spread.</p>
<p>There have also been claims made by crypto researchers that Tether may be buying up USDT and <a href="https://medium.com/@hasufly/tether-is-exiting-and-nobody-noticed-a7ce6dc30c56">planning to exit the stablecoin market</a>. This can be driven by increasing scrutiny on the business and that having a stablecoin is no longer sensible and profitable for the company. There are increasingly signs pointing so on Tuesday this week when Tether <a href="https://tether.to/upcoming-usdt-redemption-october-24th-2018/">announced</a> that it has destroyed 500 million worth of USDT from the Tether treasury wallet.</p>
<p>Current stablecoin adoption and real world implementation are still in early stages. Despite more stablecoins getting introduced this year, there have not yet been any set of standards established for the space. If Tether really is winding down its market presence, that means there is room for other coin(s) to rise at least for the existing market demand. But really it’s about stablecoins potentially going mainstream one day</p>
<p>Below is a brief look at the other coins coming on to the market, and what they have done so far.</p>
<h2>The rise of the exchange stablecoins</h2>
<p>A number of stablecoins have been in existence since 2017 but exchange stablecoins pegged to the dollar have been a big trend in the last few months.</p>
<p>Among the latest movers, crypto exchange <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gemini-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gemini-3">Gemini <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> issued the Gemini Dollar and financial blockchain solution Paxos issued the Paxos Standard. Both coins were approved by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) last month, which set a precedence for the first regulated, digital representation of the U.S. dollar to be approved in the US. Similar to Tether, both exchanges assert that their stablecoins will be fully backed by a USD reserve. Gemini touts that the balance will be examined monthly by an independent registered public accounting firm to verify the 1:1 peg. Paxos was listed a couple weeks ago on <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1048863158813655041">top cryptocurrency exchange Binance</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike non-exchange tied stablecoins, exchange- tied stablecoins enjoy certain benefits by being directly and immediately being put to use when launched. With Tether’s ongoing issue in the last few weeks, we are seeing exchanges either double downing on their own stablecoin, or diversifying to multiple different stablecoins to ensure they can capture majority of the market. Exchanges are incentivized to have their own in-house stablecoin because it allows their customers to turn any of their portfolio tokens trading on the market into stabilized tokens that they can keep as reserve — without having to rush to exchange it into fiat and worry about their portfolio change in value. Once more people hold a common stablecoin, they can transact with each other more easily and the coin could potentially grow adoption that way. This thereby indirectly raises the market cap of the exchange.</p>
<p>In mid-October, other top exchanges also started picking up their adoption and introduction of their own in-house stablecoins. OKEx, one of the top three cryptocurrency exchanges by volume, listed TrueUSD, along with Paxos Standard, Gemini Dollar and Circle’s stablecoin USD Coin. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/huobi" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="huobi">Huobi, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> another top ranked exchange by volume, followed with the same listings.</p>
<p>Huobi also listed <a href="https://blockzone.com/2018/10/19/crypto-exchange-huobi-to-launch-its-own-stablecoin-husd/">its own stablecoin solution</a>, called HUSD, which initially is launching by being the stablecoin replacement on its own exchange. And just on Tuesday this week, Coinbase backed Circle in forming the new CENTRE Consortium, and <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-and-circle-announce-the-launch-of-usdc-a-digital-dollar-2cd6548d237">announced</a> the support for USD Coin (USDC).</p>
<p>On the side, we also see numerous existing institutions that have announced and are making way into stablecoins. PWC has started getting into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/11/with-cred-partnership-pwc-wants-to-help-make-stablecoins-legit/">stablecoin advisory through partnerships</a>, while IBM most recently announced its exploration into stablecoins through a collaboration with Stellar by building a stablecoin on the Stellar blockchain.</p>
<h2>Which stablecoin could go mainstream?</h2>
<p>For the launched tokens, the question now is: can they maintain their stability as their name alludes, and reach the adoption scale that Tether used to dominate?</p>
<p>Success to the public will be the 1) number of exchanges these coins get listed on and their float, 2) the number of transactions and size of transactions committed, and now hopefully 3) ongoing verified amount of reserve.</p>
<p>There are a few early indicators of who is moving ahead, even as many stablecoin projects are still building out their products or are in the process of launching.</p>
<p>Despite recognizing the importance of Tether, the Binance research team <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/binance-stablecoins-tether-crypto/'">has said</a> that they are evaluating almost all the other stablecoins on the market to add to its platform.</p>
<p>Additionally, as <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/huobis-us-exchange-sees-30-boost-in-trading-for-tether-alternative/">reported</a> by Coindesk this last week, HBUS, the U.S. affiliate of the Singapore-based Huobi exchange, have seen both deposits and withdrawals of USDT &#8220;increased by over 10x over the last two days,”.</p>
<p>Per the spokesperson: &#8220;For deposits, users are transferring their USDT into HBUS from other exchanges to take advantage of our USDT/TUSD trading pair. There has been over a 30% increase in trading on the TUSD/USDT pair over the last two days.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is important to note that HBUS still only ranks 129th by adjusted total trading volume according to CoinMarketCap. However, these anecdotes explain how a number of these newer stablecoins broke their one-to-one fiat peg this week, and rose above $1 rather than falling below it. At least it gets some investors excited.</p>
<p>But once a token trades below or above the peg, it misses the whole purpose of stablecoin. It is evident that we are still in the early stage of the market, and over time, the token should stay stable regardless of market conditions, regardless location, and truly weather the most volatile of market times.</p>
<p>As stablecoin is still such a new arena in the cryptocurrency world, one can probably expect further insolvencies or regulatory shocks like what we saw with Tether, but in a lesser magnitude. After all, it certainly is a positive sign that many of these exchange stablecoins are now being regulated and recognized legally, as it is crucial for US-operating crypto companies’ adoption and scaling.</p>
<p>It will be most telling when trading volume returns to the scale of late 2017 to early 2018 time frame. As the market evolves, we may see true differentiation in the space, beyond yet another stablecoin maintaining reserves that are verified by a third party.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Following a $20 million round earlier this year, Quizlet is seeing solid growth in revenue and MAUs.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most students in the U.S. have used or at least heard of <a href="https://quizlet.com/">Quizlet</a>, the website for creating digital flashcards.</p>
<p>The company leverages machine learning to predict in which areas its users need the most help and provides 300 million user-generated study decks, maps, charts and other tools for learning.</p>
<p>Roughly eight months after closing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/06/quizlet-raises-20-million-for-virtual-flash-cards/">$20 million</a> financing, Quizlet chief executive officer Matthew Glotzbach has disclosed some notable feats for the emerging edtech: it&#8217;s reached 50 million monthly active users, up from 30 million one year ago, and though it&#8217;s not profitable yet, its revenue is growing 100 percent YoY.</p>
<p>As a result of its recent growth, the company is opening its first office outside of Silicon Valley, in Denver.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We by no means feel like our work is done; 50 million is a very small fraction of the 1.4 billion students on the planet,&#8221; Glotzbach told TechCrunch. &#8220;Our focus is growing the platform. If we continue to be successful in that mission, we will be the largest study and learning brand.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The company has been around for a while. Founded in 2005 by then 15-year-old <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/andrew-sutherland" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="andrew-sutherland">Andrew Sutherland, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/quizlet" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="quizlet">Quizlet <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was fully bootstrapped until 2015.</p>
<p>Its growth really began when Glotzbach, a seasoned executive most recently at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/youtube" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="youtube">YouTube, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> took the reigns in 2016. The $20 million round earlier this year, its largest yet, has allowed the company to blossom, too. Led by Icon Ventures, with participation from Union Square Ventures, Costanoa Ventures and others, it brought Quizlet&#8217;s total raised to just over $30 million.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/06/quizlet-raises-20-million-for-virtual-flash-cards/embed/#?secret=GLwKVqe284" data-secret="GLwKVqe284" width="800" height="450" title="&#8220;Quizlet raises $20 million for virtual flash cards&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Part of its growth, according to Glotzbach, has to do with its recent focus on its international users. The site has always been accessible around the world, but not until late 2016 did Quizlet <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/10/quizlet-launches-a-redesign-with-an-eye-towards-international-expansion/">begin offering</a> the tool in other languages. Today, it&#8217;s available in more than 15 languages, a number the company is actively working to expand.</p>
<p>Newly added capabilities have also contributed to recent spikes in MAUs. Students can now access diagram-based content, which is helpful for STEM subjects, an area the company has historically been less helpful with.</p>
<p>Quizlet operates a freemium model but has three subscription products for power users. At $12 per year, <span style="font-weight: 400;">Quizlet Go has no ads and provides an offline studying option on mobile. Quizlet Plus, at $20 per year, also provides an ad-free study experience, as well as image uploading and voice recording capabilities. Finally, Quizlet for Teachers offers educators a $35 per year option that lets them create their own decks for students and access to additional data, analytics and reporting.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><img class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1737660" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/uber-hero.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p>Two hackers who stole millions of users&#8217; data from ride-hailing firm <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> have been indicted on separate hacking charges related to a data breach at online learning portal Lynda, two people familiar with the case have told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Vasile Mereacre, a Canadian citizen living in Toronto, and Brandon Glover, a Florida resident, were indicted earlier this month in Florida on federal hacking and extortion charges for stealing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/12/18/lynda-data-breach/">data on 55,000 Lynda users&#8217; accounts</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5021170-Lynda-indictment.html">the recently unsealed indictment</a>, the FBI was considering extraditing Mereacre from Canada, but federal agents later learned that he was planning to fly to Miami on October 16. Mereacre was arrested by FBI agents once he landed, and made his initial appearance in court — at which the indictment was unsealed.</p>
<p>The indictment accuses the two alleged hackers of obtaining tens of thousands of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lynda-com" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lynda-com">Lynda <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> user accounts from a company-owned Amazon web server. Prosecutors accused the two of &#8220;exerting control over the accounts as a means to obtain money from LinkedIn.&#8221; Using a burner Protonmail email account, the two emailed LinkedIn and HackerOne, a bug bounty program used by Lynda, to disclose the breach.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was able to access backups upon backups,&#8221; one of the defendants wrote in their email. They also claimed to have usernames, passwords, payment data and backend code.</p>
<p>When an unnamed LinkedIn executive emailed back inviting the alleged hackers to its HackerOne bug bounty program, they said to &#8220;keep in mind, we expect a big payment as this was hard work for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two were released on a bond, and on condition that they are not permitted to use the internet. The case is now being heard in a California court.</p>
<p>The accusations are nearly identical to the circumstances around Uber&#8217;s breach, just months earlier.</p>
<p>Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/21/uber-data-breach-from-2016-affected-57-million-riders-and-drivers/">disclosed the breach</a> of 57 million worldwide users — including 4.1 million drivers — almost a year later. The company was accused of covering up the breach, after two former senior Uber executives — since fired — paid the two hackers $100,000 through its bug bounty to destroy the data that they obtained but without notifying customers or regulators.</p>
<p>Little was known about the hackers until Uber&#8217;s chief information security officer John Flynn <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-cyber-congress/uber-says-hackers-behind-2016-data-breach-were-in-canada-florida-idUSKBN1FQ2YO">told lawmakers</a> at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing in February that the two hackers were from Florida and Canada.</p>
<p>Uber declined to comment.</p>
<p>The hackers gained access to an Amazon web server, owned by Uber, using credentials that were mistakenly left in a GitHub repository by an Uber engineer. According to <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/1523054_uber_technologies_revised_complaint_0.pdf">an investigation</a> by the Federal Trade Commission, the hackers downloaded more than a dozen files — including a backup file — containing Uber customer data. It&#8217;s not known what was said in the disclosure to Uber, but the FTC claimed the hackers were &#8220;demanding&#8221; a six-figure payout.</p>
<p>The breach was one of several scandals to plague the ridesharing company and the eventual departure of founder Travis Kalanick from the company.</p>
<p>Since the breach, Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/uber-agrees-to-20-years-of-privacy-audits-to-settle-ftc-data-mishandling-probe/">agreed</a> to 20 years of privacy audits in a settlement with the FTC. The company was later ordered to pay $148 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/uber-to-pay-148-million-in-data-breach-settlement/">in its breach settlement</a>.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Glover&#8217;s public defender Michael Ryan. Mereacre&#8217;s attorney, Christopher Lyons, declined to comment. HackerOne did not comment.</p>
<p>LinkedIn spokesperson Mary-Katharine Juric said: &#8220;We appreciate the ongoing work by the FBI to pursue those believed responsible for the 2016 breach of Lynda user information. We will continue to engage with law enforcement as this case develops.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parts of Glover&#8217;s docket appear to have been withheld. Mereacre will appear in court on November 8.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If we want drones to do our dirty work for us, they&#8217;re going to need to get pretty good at hauling stuff around. But due to the pesky yet unavoidable restraints of physics, it&#8217;s hard for them to muster the forces necessary to do so while airborne — so <em>these</em> drones brace themselves against the ground to get the requisite torque.</p>
<p>The drones, created by engineers at Stanford and <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/small-flying-robots-able-to-pull-objects-up-to-40-/">Switzerland&#8217;s EPFL</a>, were inspired by wasps and spiders that need to drag prey from place to place but can&#8217;t actually <em>lift</em> it, so they drag it instead. Grippy feet and strong threads or jaws let them pull objects many times their weight along the ground, just as you might slide a dresser along rather than pick it up and put it down again. So I guess it could have also just been inspired by that.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0359IdhZMH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/20/swarms-of-tiny-cute-robots-will-one-day-bring-you-your-phone-like-this/">Swarms of tiny, cute robots will one day bring you your phone, like this</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/20/swarms-of-tiny-cute-robots-will-one-day-bring-you-your-phone-like-this/embed/#?secret=0359IdhZMH" data-secret="0359IdhZMH" width="800" height="450" title="&#8220;Swarms of tiny, cute robots will one day bring you your phone, like this&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Whatever the inspiration, these &#8220;FlyCroTugs&#8221; (a combination of flying, micro and tug presumably) act like ordinary tiny drones while in the air, able to move freely about and land wherever they need to. But they&#8217;re equipped with three critical components: an anchor to attach to objects, a winch to pull on that anchor and sticky feet to provide sure grip while doing so.</p>
<p>&#8220;By combining the aerodynamic forces of our vehicle and the interactive forces generated by the attachment mechanisms, we were able to come up with something that is very mobile, very strong and very small,&#8221; said Stanford grad student Matthew Estrada, lead author of <a href="http://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/3/23/eaau6903">the paper published in Science Robotics</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/drone_winch.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1737720" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/drone_winch.gif" alt="" width="480" height="270" /></a></p>
<p>The idea is that one or several of these ~100-gram drones could attach their anchors to something they need to move, be it a lever or a piece of trash. Then they take off and land nearby, spooling out thread as they do so. Once they&#8217;re back on terra firma they activate their winches, pulling the object along the ground — or up over obstacles that would have been impossible to navigate with tiny wheels or feet.</p>
<p>Using this technique — assuming they can get a solid grip on whatever surface they land on — the drones are capable of moving objects 40 times their weight — for a 100-gram drone like that shown, that would be about 4 kilograms, or nearly 9 pounds. Not quickly, but that may not always be a necessity. What if a handful of these things flew around the house when you were gone, picking up bits of trash or moving mail into piles? They would have hours to do it.</p>
<p>As you can see in the video below, they can even team up to do things like open doors.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/FdmS_89mVqY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;People tend to think of drones as machines that fly and observe the world,&#8221; said co-author of the paper, EPFL&#8217;s Dario Floreano, in a news release. &#8220;But flying insects do many other things, such as walking, climbing, grasping and building. Social insects can even work together and combine their strength. Through our research, we show that small drones are capable of anchoring themselves to surfaces around them and cooperating with fellow drones. This enables them to perform tasks typically assigned to humanoid robots or much larger machines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unless you&#8217;re prepared to wait for humanoid robots to take on tasks like this (and it may be a decade or two), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/modular-self-healing-robot-swarms-are-definitely-a-great-idea/">you may have to settle for drone swarms in the meantime</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vishal Makhijani, the longtime chief executive of online education company <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a>, is stepping down as its chief executive officer, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>Makhijani first joined the company in 2013 as chief operating officer under <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/sebastian-thrun" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="sebastian-thrun">Sebastian Thrun, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the company&#8217;s founder and chief executive at the time.</p>
<p>In 2016, Thrun, the original architect of Alphabet&#8217;s self-driving car initiatives and a storied entrepreneur and engineer in Silicon Valley, handed the reins of his online education startup to Makhijani, who assumed the mantle of CEO while Thrun became chairman and president of the company.</p>
<p><img class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1236426" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/udacity.jpg" alt="" width="774" height="390" /></p>
<p>In an interview, Makhijani declined to disclose his next steps, but Thrun praised the executive for taking <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/udacity" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="udacity">Udacity <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to new heights and hailed him as a key contributor to the company&#8217;s continuing growth.</p>
<p>As Thrun wrote in a blog post praising Makhijani for his tireless efforts:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the last five years, Vish worked with hundreds of tech companies to build curriculum focused on opening up new career opportunities for our students. Under Vish’s leadership, we launched more than thirty Nanodegree programs in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Self-Driving Cars, and Digital Marketing. We expanded our operations into China, India, Brazil, the Middle East, and Europe, and we started a fast-growing new enterprise division.</p></blockquote>
<p>Udacity now employs a team of 500 across the globe and its enterprise division; offering continuing education to workers through partners like PricewaterhouseCoopers and other Fortune 1000 customers has become a new engine of revenue and growth for the company.</p>
<p>It also has more than 10 million students across its paid and free classes, with over 50,000 enrolled in its nanodegree programs.</p>
<p>The financials are also looking better for Udacity. The company saw revenue rise 100 percent in 2017 to $70 million and is on track for continued revenue growth this year.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the company said there were no complaints brought against Makhijani that would have pushed him to step down.</p>
<p>With the executive&#8217;s departure, the Udacity board is instituting a new search for chief executive led by director and Andreessen Horowitz general partner, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/peter-levine" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="peter-levine">Peter Levine <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the interim, as Udacity’s founder and now executive chairman, I will work closely with Udacity&#8217;s leadership team to run the business and collaborate on a search for our new CEO,&#8221; Thrun wrote in a blog post.</p>
