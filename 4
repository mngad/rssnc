				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">CBS&#8217; streaming plans have become even more Trek-centric with <a href="https://www.cbspressexpress.com/cbs-all-access/releases/view?id=51216">the announcement</a> of a two-season order for a half-hour animated series called &#8220;Star Trek: Lower Decks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many Star Trek fans will probably recognize &#8220;Lower Decks&#8221; as the title of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Decks"> a popular &#8220;Next Generation&#8221; episode</a> about four junior officers on the Enterprise, and it sounds like the new series will take that approach even further — CBS says it will &#8220;focus on the support crew serving on one of Starfleet’s least important ships.&#8221;</p>
<p>The network says the series was developed by &#8220;Rick and Morty&#8221; writer and executive producer Mike McMahan. As you can probably tell from tongue-in-cheek plot description, &#8220;Lower Decks&#8221; is meant be a comedy. At the same time, McMahan insisted that it will be &#8220;undeniably &#8216;Trek.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently he&#8217;s a serious fan himself, having started a &#8220;Next Generation&#8221;-related Twitter account about a fictitious eighth season, then turning that account into <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Warped-Engaging-Never-Aired-Season-Generation/dp/1476779058">a book</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike won our hearts with his first sentence: ‘I want to do a show about the people who put the yellow cartridge in the food replicator so a banana can come out the other end,’&#8221; said executive producer Alex Kurtzman in a statement. &#8220;His cat’s name is Riker. His son’s name is Sagan. The man is committed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurtzman, who co-wrote two of the recent &#8220;Star Trek&#8221; big-screen blockbusters and co-created &#8220;Star Trek: Discovery,&#8221; has been spearheading efforts to <a href="https://deadline.com/2018/08/patrick-stewart-star-trek-franchise-expansion-plans-cbs-all-access-executives-interview-tca-1202440492/">launch several Star Trek spinoffs</a> on the CBS All Access streaming service, including <a href="https://deadline.com/2018/08/patrick-stewart-star-new-star-trek-series-jean-luc-picard-cbs-all-access-1202440156/">the return of Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard</a>. (To be clear, All Access has some non-Trek shows too, including &#8220;The Good Fight&#8221; and <a href="https://deadline.com/2018/09/jordan-peele-twilight-zone-cbs-all-access-rod-serling-1202468028/">the upcoming &#8220;Twilight Zone&#8221; reboot from Jordan Peele</a>.)</p>
<p>In addition to being the first original animated series on CBS All Access, &#8220;Lower Decks&#8221; is the first production from the new CBS Eye Animation Productions. And while the announcement doesn&#8217;t include a release date for the animated series, &#8220;Star Trek: Discovery&#8221; returns for its second season on January 17.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The dev team that&#8217;s now engineering the <a href="https://www.fleksy.com">Fleksy</a> keyboard app has raised more than $800,000 via an equity crowdfunding route.</p>
<p>As we reported <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/fleksy-keyboard-to-get-major-reboot-under-thingthing-dev-team/">a year ago</a>, the development of Fleksy&#8217;s keyboard has been taken over by the Barcelona-based startup behind an earlier keyboard app called ThingThing.</p>
<p>The team says their new funding raise &#8212; described as a pre-Series A round &#8212; will be put towards continued product development of the Fleksy keyboard, including the core AI engine used for next word and content prediction, plus additional features being requested by users &#8212; such as<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> swipe to type. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Support for more languages is also planned. (Fleksy&#8217;s Android and iOS apps are currently available in 45+ languages.) </span></p>
<p>Their other big push will be for growth: Scaling the user-base via a licensing route to market in which the team pitches <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/android" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="android">Android <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> OEMs on the benefits of baking Fleksy in as the default <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">keyboard &#8212; offering a high degree of customization, alongside a feature-set that boasts not just speedy typing but apps within apps and extensions. </span></p>
<p>The Fleksy keyboard can offer direct access to web search within the keyboard, for example, as well as access to third party apps (in an apps within apps play) &#8212; to reduce the need for full app switching.</p>
<p>This was the original concept behind <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/05/thingthing-takes-400k-to-turn-a-productivity-keyboard-app-into-a-services-platform/">ThingThing&#8217;s eponymous keyboard app</a>, though the team has refocused efforts on Fleksy. And bagged their first OEMs as licensing partners.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve just revealed <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/palm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="palm">Palm <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as an early partner. The veteran brand unveiled a dinky palm-sized &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/palm-returns-as-an-ultra-mobile-smartphone/">ultra-mobile&#8217; </a>last week. The tiny extra detail is that the device runs a custom version of the Fleksy keyboard out of the box.</p>
<p>With just 3.3 inches of screen to play with, the keyboard on the Palm risks being a source of stressful friction. Ergo enter Fleksy, with gesture based tricks to speed up cramped typing, plus tried and tested next-word prediction.</p>
<p>ThingThing CEO Olivier Plante says Palm was looking for an &#8220;out of the box optimized input method&#8221; &#8212; and more than that<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8220;h</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">igh customization&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to team up with ThingThing to design a custom keyboard that delivers a full keyboard typing experience for Palm&#8217;s ultra mobile form factor,&#8221; adds Dennis Miloseski, co-founder of Palm, in a statement. &#8220;Fleksy enables gestures and voice-to-text which makes typing simple and convenient for our users on the go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Plante says Fleksy has more OEM partnerships up its sleeve too. &#8220;<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">We&#8217;re pending to announce new partnerships very soon and grow our user base to more than 25 million users while bringing more revenue to the medium and small OEMs desperately looking to increase their profit margins &#8212; software is the cure,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">ThingThing is pitching itself as a neutral player in the keyboard space, offering OEMs a highly tweakable layer where the Qwerty sits as its strategy to compete with Android&#8217;s keyboard giants: Google&#8217;s Gboard and Microsoft-owned SwiftKey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> &#8220;We changed a lot of things in Fleksy so it feels native,&#8221; says Plante, discussing the Palm integration. &#8220;We love when the keyboard feels like the brand and with Palm it&#8217;s completely a Palm keyboard to the end-user &#8212; and with stellar performance on a small screen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve beaten our competitor to the punch,&#8221; he adds. </span></p>
<p>That said, the tiny Palm (pictured in the feature image at the top of this post) is unlikely to pack much of a punch in marketshare terms. While Palm is a veteran &#8212; and, to nerds, almost cult &#8212; brand it&#8217;s not even a mobile tiddler in smartphone marketshare terms.</p>
<p>Palm&#8217;s cute micro phone is also an experimental attempt to create a new mobile device category &#8212; a sort of netbook-esque concept of an extra mobile that&#8217;s extra portable &#8212; which looks unlikely to be anything other than extremely niche. (Added to its petite size, the Palm is a Verizon exclusive.)</p>
<p>Even so ThingThing is talking bullishly of targeting 550M devices using its keyboard by 2020.</p>
<p>At this stage its user-base from pure downloads is also niche: Just over 1M active users. But <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Plante says it has already closed &#8220;several phone brands partnerships&#8221; &#8212; saying three are signed, with three more in the works &#8212; claiming this will make Fleksy the default input method in more than 20-30 million active users in the coming months. </span></p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t name any names but describes these other partners as &#8220;other major phone brands&#8221;.</p>
<p>The plan to grow Fleksy&#8217;s user-base via licensing has attracted wider investor backing now, via the equity crowdfunding route. The team had initially been targeting ($300k). In all they&#8217;ve secured $815,119 from 446 investors.</p>
<p>Plante says they went down the equity crowdfunding route to spread their pitch more widely, and get more ambassadors on board &#8212; as well as to demonstrate &#8220;that we&#8217;re a user-centric/people/<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">independen<wbr></wbr>t company aiming big&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are keen to work and fully customize the keyboard to the OEM tastes. We know this is key for them so they can better compete against the others on more than simply the hardware,&#8221; he says, making the &#8216;Fleksy for OEMs&#8217; pitch. &#8220;Today, the market is saturated with yet another box, better camera and better screen&#8230;. the missing piece in Android ecosystem is software differences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given how tight margins remain for Android makers it remains to be seen how many will bite. Though there&#8217;s a revenue share arrangement that sweetens the deal.</p>
<p>It is also certainly true that differentiation in the Android space is a big problem. That&#8217;s why Palm is trying its hand at a smaller form factor &#8212; in a leftfield attempt to stand out by going small.</p>
<p>The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/european-union" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="european-union">European Union&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">antitrust ruling against Google&#8217;s Android</a> OS has also opened up an opportunity for additional software customization, via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/google-tweaks-android-licensing-terms-in-europe-to-allow-google-app-unbundling-for-a-fee/">unbundled Google apps</a>. So there&#8217;s at least a chance for some new thinking and ideas to emerge in the regional Android smartphone space. And that could be good for Spain-based ThingThing.</p>
<p>Aside from the licensing fee, the team&#8217;s business model relies on generating revenue via affiliate links and its fleksyapps platform. ThingThing then shares revenue with OEM partners, so that&#8217;s another carrot for them &#8212; offering a services topper on their hardware margin.</p>
<p>Though that piece will need scale to really spin up. Hence ThingThing&#8217;s user target for Fleksy being so big and bold.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re working with brands in order to bring them into any apps where you type, which unlocks brand new use cases and enables the user to share conveniently and the brand to drive mobile traffic to their service,&#8221; says Plante. &#8220;On this note, we monetize via affiliate/deep linking and operating a fleksyapps Store.&#8221;</p>
<p>ThingThing has also made <a href="https://www.fleksy.com/privacy">privacy by design a major focus</a> &#8212; which is a key way it&#8217;s hoping to make the keyboard app stand out against data-mining big tech rivals.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was once unusual for venture capital funds to cross the billion-dollar threshold. Now, multiple billion-dollar fund announcements in the same week is nothing to gawk at.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bessemer-venture-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bessemer-venture-partners">Bessemer Venture Partners, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> an investment firm founded more than 100 years ago, is the latest to complete the fundraising circuit. The firm has brought in $1.85 billion for its tenth flagship VC fund, its fourth consecutive billion-dollar fund, according to <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/investor/10134-73">PitchBook</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier <a href="https://www.pehub.com/vc-journal/bessemer-eyes-1-6-bln-for-10th-multistage-venture-fund/">reports</a> indicated the firm had set a $1.6 billion target for the vehicle. At the time, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/29/bessemer-is-reportedly-raising-1-6b-for-its-tenth-fund/">surmised</a> that if the firm indeed raised $1.6 billion &#8212; the size of its last two funds &#8212; it would be bucking VCs’ new favorite trend of raising their largest funds to date in defense of SoftBank&#8217;s $93 billion Vision Fund. Well, this is certainly Bessemer&#8217;s largest fund to date, but the firm says their approach is unchanged.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s no secret that many in the Valley are raising larger—and larger—funds, and others are raising multiple new funds across different stages or geographies,&#8221; the firm wrote in an <a href="https://www.bvp.com/blog/launching-bvp-x-our-tenth-fund">announcement</a> today. &#8220;As we planned BVP X, we naturally asked if we should do the same. But as we thought through how we can be the best partner to visionary entrepreneurs, we felt the right decision was to stay true to an approach that has seen 122 companies go public and helped many other entrepreneurs lay strong foundations to create revolutions of their own. At $1.85 billion, BVP X is slightly larger than our earlier funds but still allowing us to focus on what we’re passionate about making early-stage investments and sticking with companies and their leaders at every stage of their growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>With offices in Boston, New York, San Francisco, India and Israel, the Redwood City-based firm backs global startups at the seed, Series A and Series B stages. It&#8217;s known for its investments in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/shopify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="shopify">Shopify, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> LinkedIn, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/blue-apron" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="blue-apron">Blue Apron <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and several others, with a current portfolio that includes Pinterest, Zoosk, Ola, Betterment, Rocket Lab, Toast, PagerDuty, ServiceTitan and Fiverr.</p>
<p>This is the fourth massive fundraise for a VC fund in the last week. Josh Kushner&#8217;s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/thrive-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="thrive-capital">Thrive Capital announced <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the close of <a href="https://medium.com/@thrivecapital/thrive-vi-6862ece9f331">$1 billion</a> in new capital for its sixth flagship venture fund on Tuesday in what was similarly the firm&#8217;s largest raise to date. On Monday, Tiger Global garnered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/looks-like-tiger-global-management-just-closed-the-second-biggest-venture-fund-this-year/">$3.75 billion</a> for its latest fund &#8212; the second largest venture fund of 2018 &#8212; after actively marketing it for just six weeks. And only days before that, GGV Capital raised<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-16/ggv-capital-raises-1-9-billion-to-back-u-s-china-startups"> $1.9 billion</a> across three funds for U.S. and China-based companies.</p>
<p>Sequoia&#8217;s mammoth <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/playing-the-global-game-sequoia-can-cut-checks-for-up-to-1-billion/">$8 billion</a> fund, which closed this summer, remains the largest fund of the year.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> has been building out <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/paper">Paper</a>, its document-driven collaboration tool since it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/15/dropbox-announces-paper-a-google-docs-competitor/">first announced in 2015</a>, slowly but surely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/03/dropbox-drops-some-enhancements-to-paper-collaboration-layer/">layering on more functionality</a>. Today, it added a timeline feature, pushing beyond collaboration into a light-weight project planning tool.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dropbox" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dropbox">Dropbox <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has been hearing that customers really need a way to plan with Paper that was lacking. &#8220;That pain—the pain of coordinating all those moving pieces—is one we’re taking on today with our new timelines feature in Dropbox Paper,&#8221; the company <a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2018/10/paper-timelines/">wrote in a blog</a> post announcing the new feature.</p>
<p>As you would expect with such a tool, it enables you to build a timeline with milestones, but being built into Paper, you can assign team members to each milestone and add notes with additional information including links to related documents.</p>
<p>You can also embed a To-do lists for the person assigned to a task right in the timeline to help them complete the given task, giving a single point of access for all the people assigned to a project</p>
<div id="attachment_1737470" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1737470 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/unnamed.gif?w=650" alt="" width="650" height="380" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Gif: Dropbox</p></div>
<p>&#8220;Features like to-dos, @mentions, and due dates give team members easy ways to coordinate projects with each other. Timelines take these capabilities one step further, letting any team member create a clean visual representation of what’s happening when—and who’s responsible,&#8221; Dropbox wrote in the blog post announcement.</p>
<p>Dropbox has recognized it cannot live as simply a content storage tool. It needs to expand beyond that into collaboration and coordination around that content, and that&#8217;s what Dropbox Paper has been about. By adding timelines, the company is looking to expand that capability even further.</p>
<p>Alan Lepofsky, who covers the &#8220;future of work&#8221; for Constellation Research sees Paper as part of the changing face of collaboration tools. &#8220;I refer to the new breed of content creation tools as digital canvases. These apps simplify the user experience of integrating content from multiple sources. They are evolving the word-processor paradigm,&#8221; Lepofsky told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably not going to replace a project manager&#8217;s full-blown planning tools any time soon, but it at least the potential to be a useful adjunct for the Paper arsenal to allow customers to continue to find ways to extract value from the content they store in Dropbox.</p>

<p>Tesla reported a profit in the third quarter, reversing seven consecutive quarters of losses. This is only the third time in the company&#8217;s history that it has achieved this milestone.</p>

<p><strong>5. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/ribbon-series-a/">One-year-old Ribbon raises $225m to remove the biggest stress of home buying</a></strong></p>
<p>The startup wants to replace the incredible stress of securing a mortgage during the home-buying process with a Ribbon Offer: If a buyer can’t secure a mortgage in time for close, Ribbon will pay for the house itself and give the buyer extra time to get financing.</p>
<p><strong>6. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/twitter-q3-earnings/">Twitter beats Wall St Q3 estimates with $758M in revenue</a></strong></p>
<p>Twitter reported a 29 percent increase in ad revenue to $650 million, and the company says total ad engagements increased 50 percent year over year. However, user growth didn’t quite match expectations.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Short of an actual apocalypse (which should be coming any day now), this Nerf-branded gun from Hasbro is (thankfully) probably the closest you’re going to come to any real life Fortnite action in the near future. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The dart-firing gun was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/10/fortnite-monopoly-and-nerf-blasters-are-coming-soon/">announced recently</a>, alongside a Fortnite version of Monopoly (which launched earlier this month), and now we’ve got some pictures and a June 1 release date. The AR-L Blaster was inspired by the firearm in the wildly popular sandbox survival game and has the giant Fortnite branding across its body to provide it.</span></p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><img class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1737479" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FortniteXNerf_Promo_ARL_002.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="610" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The gun has a 10-dart clip, flip-up sight and runs on 4 AA batteries. It’s priced at $50 USD — V-Bucks not accepted, apparently. It’s set to be the first of a series of Nerf blasters inspired by the game, according to Hasbro. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.teikametrics.com">Teikametrics</a> is a Boston-based startup that helps retailers tackle the challenges of advertising on Amazon. Today, the company is announcing that it has raised $10 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>CEO Alasdair McLean-Foreman said third-party sellers represent 60 percent of the transactions on Amazon. But they don&#8217;t have any real data science capabilities, so they need help advertise their goods in a way that maximizes profitability.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are using big data to help sellers optimize for profitability,&#8221; McLean-Foreman said. He compared it to the work that Amazon has done &#8220;optimizing on the consumer side — all the advanced econometrics&#8221; to determine things like the price of Amazon Prime. &#8220;We’re on the other side. We’re helping sellers and brands.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a very different challenge from optimizing Facebook ads to get the most clicks. McLean-Foreman argued that it&#8217;s not even something Amazon can do properly, because, &#8220;They don’t have critical information on cost of goods sold, and they also don&#8217;t have the context of being on the supply chain side.&#8221;</p>
<p>(At the same time, he emphasized, &#8220;We’re aligned with Amazon, we&#8217;re pro-Amazon and we&#8217;ve built our company off the back of Amazon.&#8221;)</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xHdqoaOYSrI" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>In contrast, Teikametrics — through its &#8220;retail optimization platform&#8221; Flywheel — allows sellers to incorporate things like transaction data, inventory data and pricing data. So when they look at the results of of their campaigns, they can see their gross profit margins and profitability after ad spend.</p>
<p>How appealing is this to sellers? Well, Teikametrics says it&#8217;s being used by advertisers who represent 1 percent of all sales on Amazon, including brands like Razer, Power Practical and Zipline Ski. Eventually, the company plans to expand its technology beyond Amazon, to other marketplaces.</p>
<p>Teikametrics has been bootstrapped since its founding in 2013, at least until now. McLean-Foreman said he decided to raise outside funding because &#8220;the crown jewel is the sheer amount of data that we can model,&#8221; which means hiring &#8220;a tremendous amount of very, very high-powered machine learning folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Series A funding was led by Granite Point Capital, Jump Capital and FJ Lab.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A growing number of states has legalized retail marijuana sales, but ensuring that everything works as advertised is no easy task. Among the many things that regulators have to concern themselves with are granting licenses to dispensaries, retail sales, delivery, distribution, and ensuring marijuana has been tested for pesticides and other materials before it hits the shelf (or doorstep).</p>
<p>In California, the software system that&#8217;s being used statewide to record the inventory and movement of cannabis and cannabis products through the commercial cannabis supply chain is made by <a href="https://www.metrc.com/">Metrc</a>, a low-flying, five-year-old, Lakeland, Florida company. In fact, Metrc now services 11 states altogether, including Colorado, Oregon, Alaska, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, and Louisiana. It&#8217;s also used by regulators in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the kind of traction that investors notice, and indeed, today Metrc is announcing its first outside round of funding, in the form of $50 million from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiger-global" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tiger-global">Tiger Global Management <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Casa Verde Ventures, the three-year-old, cannabis-focused venture firm that was famously cofounded by rapper Snoop Dogg but is largely managed by Goldman Sachs and Nomura Securities alum Karan Wadhera.</p>
<p>Wadhera tells us he&#8217;d been following Metrc for a &#8220;number of years as it became one of the de facto track-and-trace systems&#8221; for government entities that regulate the cannabis industry. Eventually, he introduced to the company Tiger, with which Case Verde &#8220;shares deal flow quite regularly,&#8221; says Wadhera, pointing to another co-investment the two firms have made together in <a href="https://www.greenbits.com/">Green Bits</a>, a maker of point-of-sale software for dispensaries. (Worth noting: Green Bits launched at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/22/green-bits-launches-point-of-sale-service-for-cannabis-shops/">TechCrunch Disrupt in 2015</a>.)</p>
<p>Certainly, that kind of working relationship helps, but the supply chain expertise of Metrc CEO Jeff Wells also presumably gave Tiger and Casa Verde confidence in their investment. Not so long ago, Metrc was part of a larger company called Franwell that was founded by Wells in 1993 and that quickly began developing products for the RFID market. More specifically, Wells tells us, Franwell began focusing on cold chain management and fresh foods, building up resources, research, and knowledge along the way . &#8212; including about regulated markets &#8212; that he believes gives an edge to its clients today, including those of Metrc.</p>
<p>As for how Metrc will use its fresh capital, Wells says the company plans to remain focused solely on regulators but to &#8220;look to expand our regulatory focus,&#8221; including, eventually, by potentially expanding into &#8220;other regulated markets and products that need the type of tools that Metrc has created.&#8221; The company, which currently employs roughly 100 people, also expects to work eventually with both domestic and international regulators.</p>
<p>Surely, as more state and sovereign governments legalize cannabis, compliance will play an even more critical role. Says Wadhera of the deal, &#8220;Compliance is the backbone of the cannabis industry. If a license holder isn&#8217;t compliant, their business will cease to exist.&#8221; That&#8217;s good for proponents of greater accessibility to cannabis. It&#8217;s good for consumers who can be better assured that the products they&#8217;re buying is safe. For Metrc and now Tiger and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/casa-verde-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="casa-verde-capital">Casa Verde Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> that&#8217;s also good for business.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitch continues to dominate the live streaming market, with approximately 2.5 billion hours watched by viewers in the third quarter of 2018, according to a new industry report out this morning. While YouTube still trails, it&#8217;s begun to close the gap with Twitch, it appears. YouTube&#8217;s live streaming platform, YouTube Live, started the year with 15 percent of the overall live streaming market&#8217;s viewership, but by September 2018, it had grown to roughly 25 percent of all live streaming hours viewed.</p>
<p>These findings, and more, were the subject of a &#8220;state of the industry&#8221; report released today by <a href="http://www.streamelements.com/">StreamElements</a>, which also dug into what&#8217;s making these live streaming sites tick.</p>
<p>Of course, Twitch is still the market leader, with around 750 million monthly viewers, on average, who watched over 813 million hours in September. YouTube Live, by comparison, saw over 226 million hours that month, and Microsoft&#8217;s Mixer saw just 13+ million.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1737429" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/streaming-hours-watched-q3-2018.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="343" /></p>
<p>Also of note is that Twitch&#8217;s growth is now coming from the long tail, the report claims. Its top 100 channels haven&#8217;t grown much since the beginning of the year &#8211; in fact, they&#8217;re down a bit, according to the findings. In January 2018, viewers watch around 262 million hours on the top 100, which dropped to 254 million in September.</p>
<p>In addition, Twitch is growing viewership thanks to its expanded focus outside of gaming content. IRL streaming &#8211; meaning, watching creators &#8220;in real life&#8221; going about their day, vlogging, or participating in other activities, for example &#8211; is now one of the site&#8217;s most consistently growing categories, with 41 million more hours watched in Q3 2018 than in Q1.</p>
<p>This growth likely impacted Twitch&#8217;s recent decision to do away with the overarching &#8220;IRL&#8221; category to instead break down the content into subcategories like music, food &amp; drink, ASMR, beauty, and more, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/10/twitch-is-closing-its-communities/">other organizational changes</a> to its site.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1737431" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/irl-hours-watched.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="349" /></p>
<p>StreamElements also claims that game streams and other content &#8211; but not the competitions known as &#8220;esports&#8221; &#8211;  are what&#8217;s attracting viewers.</p>
<p>Esports viewership now makes up 9 to 17 percent of overall Twitch viewership, the report says. (This is consistent with <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/esports-drives-21-3-of-twitch-viewership/">findings</a> Newzoo has reported in past years, as well.)</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1737432" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/twitch-esports-2018.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="384" /></p>
<p>The report&#8217;s data, however, is not first-party &#8211; it comes from StreamElements&#8217; position as a production and community management solutions provider for live streamers, which allows it some insight into live streaming trends. The company also partnered with streaming analysts <a href="http://www.streamhatchet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.streamhatchet.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1540563642410000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEdDbUdkrvZ1DwaBp2Wlht8cnKL6g">StreamHatchet</a> to compile this report, it says.</p>
<p>That being said, it&#8217;s not the only one to point to YouTube&#8217;s more recent growth. In StreamLabs&#8217; <a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/livestreaming-q218-report-streamlabs-obs-doubles-tipping-breaks-record-36m-twitch-hits-1m-ef41d2c61923">Q2 report this year</a>, it also found that YouTube&#8217;s live gaming streams were on the rise, as was viewership. But StreamLabs tends to look at concurrent streams and viewership, so it&#8217;s not a direct comparison.</p>
<p>YouTube recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/18/youtube-to-shut-down-standalone-gaming-app-as-gaming-gets-a-new-home-on-youtube/">did away with its standalone YouTube Gaming app</a>, and incorporated gaming content more directly into its main site. This could impact its future growth even more than is reflected in this Q3-focused report.</p>
<p>Finally, the report also found that Fortnite&#8217;s popularity may have peaked &#8211; it&#8217;s still the most watched game on Twitch, but since reaching over 151 million hours watched in July, it&#8217;s been shedding viewers. The game saw 20 million fewer hours viewed in August, then dropped by another 25 million hours in September.</p>

Can he conquer the e-commerce world, too?</p>
<p>Hot off the heels of its first profitable year, ShopRunner is announcing its first infusion of venture funding under Yagan, an acquisition of the shopping app <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/spring-is" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="spring-is">Spring <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and, sources tell TechCrunch, it&#8217;s readying a major overhaul to its mobile app, signaling what could be a new era for the company.</p>
<p>Yagan, the co-founder of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/okcupid" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="okcupid">OkCupid, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> former CEO and vice chairman of The Match Group and managing director of the venture fund <a href="http://www.corazoncap.com/about.html">Corazon Capital</a> joined <a href="https://www.shoprunner.com/">ShopRunner</a> in 2016 to test the waters of online retail.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at founding OkCupid, running Match and incubating Tinder, arguably, I had my hands on the three most important dating businesses ever,&#8221; Yagan told TechCrunch. &#8220;Finally, I was like, &#8216;what else is there?&#8217; I am either going to the grave as the online dating guy, or this was the moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yagan replaced former <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/paypal" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="paypal">PayPal <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> president Scott Thompson as ShopRunner&#8217;s CEO, moved the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/alibaba" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="alibaba">Alibaba <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-backed subscription-based digital shopping company from Silicon Valley to his hometown, Chicago, and readied for battle against Amazon.</p>
<p>ShopRunner teams with mid- to high-end retailers to offer its paying members free two-day shipping and free returns on their sites, taking a small cut of each purchase. As much as it might like to, it doesn&#8217;t compete with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Prime. It doesn&#8217;t even have a centralized marketplace where users can shop all the ShopRunner partner brands at once, but that may change.</p>
<p>This week, it announced a $40 million investment from August Capital, bringing its total equity funding to around $140 million since it was founded in 2009. The company says it plans to use the cash for product development, data science and to amp up its M&amp;A strategy. It&#8217;s already begun the latter, confirming to TechCrunch that it&#8217;s acquired Alan and David Tisch&#8217;s <a href="https://www.shopspring.com">Spring,</a> a deal first reported by <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/10/5/17939860/shoprunner-spring-acquisition-michael-rubin-david-tisch">Recode</a>.</p>
<p>Yagan declined to disclose both ShopRunner&#8217;s latest valuation and the terms of the Spring acquisition. Though he did say ShopRunner&#8217;s valuation is in the &#8220;hundreds of millions&#8221; range and that they had purchased Spring&#8217;s platform and 30 of its employees, a majority of which are engineers.</p>
<p>ShopRunner did not take on all of Spring&#8217;s employees. Why? Yagan said it was because the two were similar companies and there wasn&#8217;t a need for Spring&#8217;s entire team. As a result, Spring&#8217;s remaining employees, a mix of engineers and otherwise, are joining real estate tech startup <a href="https://www.compass.com/">Compass</a> as part of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/real-estate-upstart-compass-acquires-part-of-shopping-app-spring-including-20-engineers-and-cto/">separate transaction</a>, Spring&#8217;s CEO<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alantisch/"> Alan Tisch</a> confirmed to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Backed with $105 million in VC funding, Spring had reportedly struggled to scale and had drifted from the <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/spiral-springs-great-mobile-experiment/">mobile-first strategy</a> it touted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/14/spring-david-tischs-latest-venture-is-instagram-for-shopping/">right out of the gate</a>. TechCrunch&#8217;s Ingrid Lunden has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/real-estate-upstart-compass-acquires-part-of-shopping-app-spring-including-20-engineers-and-cto/"> more on this</a> and Compass&#8217; acquihire.</p>

<p>ShopRunner and Spring had some preexisting ties. Recode reports that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/michael-rubin-5" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="michael-rubin-5">Michael Rubin, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the billionaire owner of ShopRunner via <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kynetic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kynetic">Kynetic, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> ShopRunner&#8217;s parent company, is close friends with Alan. Moving forward, Alan is serving as an advisor to ShopRunner, while Spring&#8217;s president Marshall Porter will continue to lead the startup.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shopping on your phone isn&#8217;t fun and it&#8217;s not easy,&#8221; Alan told TechCrunch. &#8220;And many of the brands that people love and shop every day you can&#8217;t find on Amazon. We wanted to create an experience that was as fun and easy as walking into a great store. We still don&#8217;t feel today that the dream has been fully realized but we think combining the scale of ShopRunner and the product Spring has really puts us in the position to make that happen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>By pairing up with Spring, ShopRunner is multiplying the number of brands available to its paying members by 10 and offering, for the first time, an actual marketplace where customers can gain access to hundreds of those brands at once.</p>
<p>For now, both companies will continue to operate independently, but Yagan says they will revisit whether to fully merge the platforms in 2019.</p>
<p>Spring is ShopRunner&#8217;s first major M&amp;A deal, but won&#8217;t be its last. Yagan said they have their eyes peeled for any-point solutions that help retailers take on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/jeff-bezos" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="jeff-bezos">Jeff Bezos, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> or that have large member bases and provide a great shopping experience.</p>
<p>Finally, according to sources familiar with the company, ShopRunner is planning to unveil a major update to its mobile app in November. Historically, users weren&#8217;t able to access ShopRunner brands via its app, making it an essentially useless piece of the company&#8217;s product. The update, coupled with the acquisition of Spring, will put ShopRunner on the path toward creating a digital mall with frictionless payments, a necessary step forward for the aspiring Amazon competitor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google Maps has been steadily rolling out new features to make its app more than just a way to find places and navigate to them. In recent months, it&#8217;s added things like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/google-launches-its-group-planning-feature-for-maps/">group trip planning</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/01/google-maps-adds-commute-tab-and-music-controls/">music controls</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/01/google-maps-adds-commute-tab-and-music-controls/">commuter tools</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/18/google-maps-eta-sharing-feature-hits-ios/">ETA sharing</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/26/the-new-google-maps-with-personalized-recommendations-is-now-live/">personalized recommendations</a>, and more. Now, it&#8217;s introducing a new way for users to follow their favorite businesses, as well &#8211; like restaurants, bars, or stores, for example &#8211; in order to stay on top of their news and updates.</p>
<p>If that sounds a lot like Google Maps&#8217; own version of Facebook Pages, you&#8217;re right.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.blog.google/products/maps/fresh-ways-stay-date-your-favorite-places-and-find-new-ones/">Explains the company</a>, once you tap the new &#8220;follow&#8221; to track a business, you&#8217;ll then be able to see news from those places like their upcoming events, their offers, and other updates right in the &#8220;For You&#8221; tab on Google Maps.</p>
<p>Events, deals and photo-filled posts designed to encourage foot traffic? That definitely sounds like a Facebook Page competitor aimed at the brick-and-mortar crowd.</p>
<p>Businesses can also use the Google Maps platform to start reaching potential customers before they open to the public, Google notes.</p>
<p><img class="vertical alignnone size-large wp-image-1737407" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/agmm_follow.gif?w=280" alt="" width="280" height="498" /></p>
<p>After building a Business Profile using <a href="https://www.google.com/business/">Google My Business</a> which includes their opening date, the business will then be surfaced in users&#8217; searches on mobile web and in the app, up to three months before their opening.</p>
<p>This profile will display the opening date in orange just below the business name, and users can save the business to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/13/google-maps-lets-you-save-and-share-favorite-places-with-launch-of-lists/">one of their lists,</a> if they choose. Users can also view all the other usual business information, like address, phone, website and photos.</p>
<p>The new &#8220;follow&#8221; feature will be accessible to the over 150 million places already on Google Maps, as well as the millions of users who are seeking them out.</p>
<p>The feature has been spotted in the wild for some time before Google&#8217;s official announcement this week, and is rolling out over the next few weeks, initially on Android.</p>
<p>The &#8220;For You&#8221; tab is currently available in limited markets, with more countries coming soon, says Google.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Can’t wait to get your giant hand on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/palm-returns-as-an-ultra-mobile-smartphone/">Palm’s tiny “ultra-mobile?”</a> Turns out it will be arriving sooner than later — next Friday, in fact. Verizon (you know, the giant telecom that owns the media conglomerate that owns TechCrunch) announced today that it will be launching the strange new thing <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/introducing-palm-worlds-first-ultra-mobile-companion-your-smartphone-exclusively-verizon">on November 2</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 3.3-inch device runs $349 off-contract. On-contract, it’s $14.58 a month for two years. It will be available through the carrier’s stores o through Best Buy kiosks. The companies are also betting big on accessories, from companies including Kate Spade, Zagg, LifeActiv and some Verizon-branded products.</span></p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><img class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1732289" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CMB_50041.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Makes sense, as the device is being positioned as somewhere between a smartphone and smartwatch, given its small size. It’s novel, for sure, the notion of what’s essentially a smaller, second phone. It’s also fairly retro, both from the standpoint of the startup licensing out the familiar name and the fact that it sports roughly the same size screen as the original iPhone. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I know I’m excited to try the thing out. The built quality is certainly there from my initial impressions, and you can’t really go wrong with a design that looks like nothing more than a shrunk down iPhone. Of course, the company has painted itself into a bit of a corner with a single carrier launch for a device that already includes a number of barriers to entry.</span></p>
<p><img class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1732274" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SC30_3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, with the run that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkFOV1fFycY">Steph’s been having lately,</a> maybe they’ll pull it off, after all. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Streaming news company Cheddar announced this morning it&#8217;s acquiring<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ratemyprofessors"> Rate My Professors</a>, the Viacom-owned site where students go online to rate and review their professors and schools across the U.S. The site, founded in 1999, has become something of a staple on the web, and by its nature it attracts the young demographic that Cheddar itself is also after.</p>
<p>According to Cheddar, Rate My Professors is being used by more than 6 million college students per month, who write an average of 125,000 new professor and class ratings monthly. Seasonally, these figures peak at 7 million and 300,000, respectively.</p>
<p>The site traffic has been steadily growing year-over-year, and it now boasts 20 million total ratings across 1.8 million professors. Its iOS app has thousands of reviews, and a 4.8 star rating, as well.</p>
<p>Cheddar already has big plans for its new purchase, promising a site redesign and a set of features for professors, it says.</p>
<p>“Rate My Professors is a trusted tool for millions of students each month; we’re excited to redesign the site, improve the user experience, and offer students a better toolset to search, evaluate and compare professors” said Eric Harris, President and Chief Operating Officer of Cheddar, in a statement. “In 2019, we also plan to offer educators a premium toolset similar to those offered to employers by Glassdoor.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1737387" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rate-my-professors.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="347" /></p>
<p>Despite the overlap in demographics, the site isn&#8217;t the most obvious choice for Cheddar, whose key focus to date has been on its streaming news networks.</p>
<p>Today, Cheddar operates two live video networks: the business news network Cheddar, which often scoops tech news stories; and the newer Cheddar Big News, which is its fast-paced general and headline news network. These channels are carried across streaming TV and video services, like Sling TV, Hulu, YouTube TV, fuboTV, Philo, and Amazon and on social platforms like Snapchat, Twitch, Facebook, and Twitter.</p>
<p>It also operates the place-based CheddarU network across 1,600 on 600 campuses &#8211; or a reach of 9 million students.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Cheddar says it&#8217;s bringing in Taboola as a strategic in-feed discovery partner for Cheddar’s Rate My Professors. Taboola says it will bring an infinite scrolling experience to the site, through its Taboola Feed &#8211; a personalized experience designed for those who grew up scrolling through social media.</p>
<p>Rate My Professors is not the first move Cheddar has made recently as a part of a strategy to reach the coveted younger demographic.</p>
<p>It <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180531006333/en/CheddarU-Million-Students-600-Campuses-1600-Screens">also in May 2018 bought Viacom’s MTV Networks on Campus</a>, the distribution platform for Viacom’s campus-based service, MTVU &#8211; which then became CheddarU. Chegg and Pandora were launch partners, with Chegg collaborating on programming focused on education and study, and Pandora on daily coverage of artists, playlists and music charts.</p>
<p>With the new acquisition, Cheddar gains a user-generated content site that has a strong direct-to-consumer relationship, Cheddar CEO Jon Steinberg tells us.</p>
<p>&#8220;We already have a superior model to traditional ad-supported media companies &#8211; we are in premium skinny bundles next to CNN and CNBC and focused on live, not page views. Everyone, even NBC is chasing us&#8230;but we are one step ahead!,&#8221; he said.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><img class="breakout alignnone wp-image-1737383 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-550274689.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="729" /></p>
<p>About 800 kilometers of unused fiber optic cable running down the U.S. eastern seaboard is set to become the first stateside quantum network.</p>
<p>The aim is to get the quantum network up and running and accepting customers by the end of the year, making it the first time that quantum keys will be exchanged commercially on U.S. soil.</p>
<p>Quantum Xchange, a Bethesda, Maryland-based quantum communications provider, has inked a deal for Zayo, a fiber network giant, to provide the stretch of fiber from Boston to Washington, DC. Its first aim is to help connect Wall Street financiers with their back operations in nearby New Jersey, but the hope is that other industries — from healthcare to critical infrastructure — will soon use the network for their own secure communications.</p>
<p>Quantum cryptography and networking aren&#8217;t new concepts, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/18/theres-now-proof-that-quantum-computers-can-outperform-classical-machines/">have risen to prominence in recent years</a> as both a threat to some encryption and also the savior of future secure communications. Relying on photons and the laws of quantum physics to share encryption keys over a long distance from one place to another makes it significantly harder to intercept the keys without breaking the beam or perfectly cloning a copy. This technique, known as quantum key distribution (QKD), is seen as a likely contender for the future of end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p>Although quantum cryptography has been around for years, it&#8217;s only been recently that scientists and computer engineers have harnessed the technology for practical uses. Soon, the technology could be used for protecting elections, transmitting payments and securing communications between data centers — even from satellites back to earth.</p>
<p>Europe has already <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612327/europes-quest-for-an-unhackable-quantum-internet/">seen some success</a> in building a small-scale quantum network, but &#8220;shortcomings&#8221; made bringing the system to the U.S. more difficult, said Quantum Xchange chief executive John Prisco.</p>
<p>His company uses trusted node technology that passes quantum key data from point to point over a larger distance, making it easier to scale a quantum network over wider geographical spaces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Organizations with offices in Boston will be able to send secure communications to a partner in D.C., and eventually even further – as the goal is to keep buying up optical fiber that is already in the ground all over the country so that we can provide a secure quantum network that will serve the entire nation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Prisco said it&#8217;s &#8220;critical&#8221; to establish a quantum key distribution network as a defensive measure &#8220;before the unprecedented power of quantum computers become an offensive weapon.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Big problems require big war chests. <a href="https://www.ribbonhome.com">Ribbon</a> wants the biggest chest of them all.</p>
<p>The startup, which was founded just about a year ago by ex-LendingClub head of strategic development Shaival Shah and ex-Twitter/TellApart engineer Jian Wei Gan (who, full disclosure, is married to TechCrunch columnist Joyce Yang), wants to replace the incredible stress of securing a mortgage during the home buying process with a Ribbon Offer: If a buyer can’t secure a mortgage in time for close, Ribbon will pay for the house itself and give the buyer extra time to get financing.</p>
<p>It’s a simple premise, but potentially revolutionary in its effect on home buying in the United States, and Ribbon’s investors have taken notice. After raising a small seed earlier this year, the company announced today that it has raised $225 million in a combination of debt and Series A equity financing. (The company refused to go on the record about the breakdown of debt and equity.) The equity portion was led by its existing seed investors Bain Capital Ventures, Greylock, NFX and NYCA.</p>
<p>Understanding Ribbon requires understanding the immense difficulties of consumer home buying. <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/06/30/business/poll-home-ownership.html">Home ownership remains a dream for most Americans</a>, but actually purchasing a home in the United States remains incredibly challenging. From finding a home to negotiating with a seller and handling hundreds of pages of paperwork — all of it together can create one of the most stressful periods of anyone’s life.</p>
<p>And it is getting even more intense. For consumers buying homes, their competitors are often not their fellow humans, but rather large investment firms that come with all-cash offers and guarantees to close. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-your-new-landlord-wall-street-1500647417">As The Wall Street Journal noted last year</a> in a deep dive on the practice, “All told, big investors have spent some $40 billion buying about 200,000 houses, renovating them and building rental-management businesses, estimates real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors LLC.”</p>
<p>That has made mortgage financing — necessary for most buyers — an increasingly common no-go for home sellers. To solve for this, <a href="https://www.ribbonhome.com">Ribbon</a> wants to give every consumer the leverage of an all-cash offer while eliminating the mortgage contingency in home buying.</p>
<div id="attachment_1737370" style="width: 349px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="vertical size-large wp-image-1737370" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ios-app-home-for-client.png?w=339" alt="" width="339" height="680" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ribbon&#8217;s app allows home buyers to find houses and determine Ribbon Offer prices (Photo from Ribbon)</p></div>
<p>When purchasing a home, buyers who need mortgage financing will include a clause in the home purchase contract stating that if they are unable to get a mortgage in time for closing, they are able to walk away from a deal, generally without financial penalty. This is known as a mortgage contingency.</p>
<p>That clause puts sellers in a bind: move forward with such a buyer, and their creditworthiness will determine whether a transaction is completed. Yet, sellers don’t really know their buyers, and they have very little visibility into a buyer’s ability to get a mortgage. Pre-approved mortgages help here, when they are available, but are a poor substitute for cash.</p>
<p>Ribbon takes on home buyers as clients and assesses their likelihood of securing a mortgage using data science. If convinced that a buyer will get a mortgage, it then offers a Ribbon guarantee to the seller that if financing falls through, it will offer the cash needed to close the transaction.</p>
<p>“We guarantee a close and we guarantee a move in,” explained Shah, who is CEO. He emphasized that “we are not just providing a cash offer, but a guarantee to close … which creates certainty in the real estate process.”</p>
<div id="attachment_1737372" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1737372" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/7612-Bosham-home.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" /><p class="wp-caption-text">One of Ribbon&#8217;s early purchases was this home (Photo from Ribbon)</p></div>
<p>Ribbon is free for buyers, and the company charges a 1.95 percent fee at closing from sellers. It is not uncommon for home sellers to discount their home price for all-cash offers due to the greater certainty of close, and Ribbon believes the same pattern will hold true for its Ribbon Offer. “Our view is that if discounts are going to exist because of the cash guarantee … let that discount flow through to the consumer ecosystem,” Shah explained.</p>
<p>If a mortgage falls through at the last minute, Ribbon will buy the home and wait for the buyer to secure a different mortgage. That process can sometimes be just a few days, which means that Ribbon doesn’t need to hold substantial housing inventory or take on macroeconomic risk, and can turn over its debt quite rapidly.</p>
<p>The company launched in Charlotte, North Carolina and has been in the market for about six months. Shah said that the company “tripled” transaction volume from Q2 to Q3, although demurred on deeper details of the company’s revenues. Charlotte was chosen both because home prices are cheaper than in major global cities like New York City and San Francisco, and because the percentage of cash offers locally has hovered slightly above one-third in recent years, according to company data, due to a surge in corporate buying.</p>
<p>Ribbon wants to be “Switzerland” according to Shah, which means working with existing realtors and existing mortgage lenders in a neutral and non-competitive way. He doesn’t see a world in which the company would offer its own mortgage products (at least, not yet), and instead wants to focus on perfecting the data models that underwrite its guarantee.</p>
<p>Home buying startups have been heavily financed by venture capitalists, including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/opendoor-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="opendoor-2">Opendoor, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which has raised $1 billion, and others like Perch and Knock. Shah says that his competitors primarily focus on sellers rather than buyers, and Ribbon wants to do the opposite.</p>
<p>The company intends to expand to 10 new markets in the coming year, and has already grown organically through realtor referrals to expand to Asheville and Cary, North Carolina.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google this morning <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/learn-and-do-more-lens-google-images/">announced</a> it&#8217;s bringing its A.I.-powered Lens technology to Google Image Search. The idea, explains the company, is to allow web searchers to learn more about what&#8217;s in a photo &#8211; including, in particular, items they may want to shop for and buy. For example, a photo of a well-decorated living room might have a sofa you like, but the photo itself wouldn&#8217;t have necessarily informed you who made the sofa or where it was for sale.</p>
<p>Google Lens &#8211; yes, acting very much like Pinterest &#8211; will now be able to help with that.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be able to tap on &#8220;dots&#8221; that appear within the photo, which designate items Google Lens has identified, or you can use your finger to &#8220;draw&#8221; around an object in the photo to trigger Google Images to search for related information. Google then searches across the web, including for other images, web pages, and even videos where this object may appear.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just for shopping, of course. Google Lens can also be used to learn more about landmarks, animals, places you want to travel and more.</p>
<p><img class="vertical alignnone size-large wp-image-1737367" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Lens-Sofa.gif?w=339" alt="" width="339" height="680" /></p>
<p>But Google naturally sees a good fit for Lens when it comes to directing users to products and, therefore, the websites of potential Google advertisers. This is the area where Pinterest has been steadily advancing.</p>
<p>Pinterest last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/10/pinterest-reports-25-increase-in-monthly-active-users/">reported a 25 percent increase in monthly active users</a>, as it gears up for its IPO. That means more people are starting their shopping journeys on its site, looking for purchase inspiration around things like fashion, home décor, travel, and other ideas. It&#8217;s also been beefing up its advertising product to further capture users&#8217; interests and connect them with brands, having earlier this year added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/31/pinterest-gives-advertisers-a-way-to-show-promoted-videos-that-take-up-the-screen/">promoted videos to its ad products. </a></p>
<p>And just a week ago, Pinterest announced it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/pinterest-is-turning-more-of-its-window-shoppers-into-buyers-with-newest-features/">rebuilt the infrastructure around product pins</a> to make its site and app more &#8220;shoppable,&#8221; while reporting that tests of the changes had shown a 40 percent increase in visits to retailers&#8217; site, as a result.</p>
<p>For these reasons &#8211; not to mention the looming threat of Facebook and Instagram ads sending users directly to retailers&#8217; websites, and <a href="https://www.axios.com/amazon-becoming-3rd-biggest-digital-ad-platform-37338b9c-54f5-42cd-b081-79698e89f559.html">Amazon&#8217;s not insignificant entry</a> into the advertising business &#8211; it&#8217;s clear that it was time for Google to leverage its own technology to help improve shopping and click-through rates for retailers on its site, as well.</p>
<p>Google says Lens in Images is now live on the mobile web for people in the U.S. searching in English, and will soon be rolled out to other countries, languages and Google Images locations.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/founders-fund" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="founders-fund">Founders Fund <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has led the $6 million Series A for <a href="https://www.summersalt.com/">Summersalt</a>, an early-stage e-commerce startup embracing the next-gen consumer&#8217;s penchant for inclusivity and affordability.</p>
<p>Headquartered in St. Louis, the 1-year old company sells swimsuits designed in-house with eco-friendly fabrics directly to consumers. Like other D2C brands, Summersalt cuts out the middlemen to give its customers access to its swimsuits for $95 or less. What sets it apart is its data-focused fit system. With a patent on recommending garments based on body type and consumer preference, it uses more than 10,000 scans of real women&#8217;s bodies and some 1.5 million measurements to create what it says are designer-quality garments.</p>
<p>Co-founder and chief executive officer Lori Coulter and her team design all the swimsuits and source the fabrics directly with factories in the U.S. and Asia. With the latest investment, Coulter says the company will launch a line of travel wear and expand its inventory to offer more sizes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A core value of the brand really is inclusivity and we know from an economic perspective that by moving up to size 22, we really can acquire a broader set of consumers,&#8221; Coulter told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><img class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1737156" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/6.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="667" /><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reshmachattaram/">Reshma Chattaram Chamberlin</a>, co-founder and chief brand officer, said their strategy is to cater to women like them. Chamberlin herself is an immigrant, originally from Mumbai, while Coulter, a mother of two, was born and raised in Missouri.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We were both tired of seeing the oversexualized approach to swimwear,&#8221; Chamberlain told TechCrunch. &#8220;We wanted a brand to appeal to women like us so we could feel sexy on our own terms. We wanted to appeal to women across the country, whether that&#8217;s a mom in Missouri or a stylish girl in Brooklyn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Women like us are immigrants. Women like us are moms. Women like us are size 2 and women like us are size 22,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>The pair said the move to incorporate a travel line is in keeping with their wanderlust-themed brand, which appeals to younger consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a unique time in retail; women prefer experiences over things,&#8221; Coulter said. &#8220;We really see this as the next frontier in retail. We want to position Summersalt as the next-generation brand focused around travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/peter-thiel" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="peter-thiel">Peter Thiel <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-owned Founders Fund&#8217;s first investment in the startup, which previously raised <span style="font-weight: 400;">a <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/mergers-acquisitions/swimwear-start-up-summersalt-raises-2-million-seed-round-1202644521/">$2 million</a> seed round in March 2018. </span>Lewis and Clark Ventures, Revolution’s Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, Dundee Venture Capital, Breakout Capital, Cultivation Capital, Victress Capital, Amplifyher Ventures, M25 and Giuliana and Bill Rancic also participated in the funding.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/european-parliament" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="european-parliament">European Parliament <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has called for a full audit of Facebook following a string of data breach scandals &#8212;  including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cambridge-analytica/">Cambridge Analytica affair</a>.</p>
<p>MEPs are urging the company to allow <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/european-union" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="european-union">European Union <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> bodies to carry out a full audit to assess data protection and security of users’ personal data, following the scandal in which the data of 87 million Facebook users was improperly obtained and misused.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20181018IPR16525/facebook-cambridge-analytica-meps-demand-action-to-protect-citizens-privacy">resolution</a>, adopted today, they have also recommended Facebook make additional changes to combat election interference &#8212; asserting the company has not just breached the trust of European users &#8220;but indeed EU law&#8221;.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the company for comment on the parliament&#8217;s resolution.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/11/audit-facebook-and-overhaul-competition-law-say-meps-responding-to-breach-scandals/">Earlier this month</a> the EU parliament&#8217;s civil liberties committee adopted a similar resolution, calling for a full and independent audit of Facebook and for the company to make further changes to its platform.</p>
<p>The Libe committee also called for an update to EU competition rules to reflect what it dubs “the digital reality”, and investigation of what it called the “possible monopoly” of big tech social media platforms.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement today, following the parliament&#8217;s vote, civil liberties committee chair Claude Moraes said: “This is a global issue, which has already affected our referenda and our elections. This resolution sets out the measures that are needed, including an independent audit of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> an update to our competition rules, and additional measures to protect our elections. Action must be taken now, not just to restore trust in online platforms, but to protect citizens’ privacy and restore trust and confidence in our democratic systems.”</p>
<p>The resolution follows an appearance by Facebook&#8217;s founder <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="mark-zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in front of the EU parliament&#8217;s Conference of Presidents in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/22/zuckerberg-didnt-make-any-friends-in-europe-today/">May</a>, and a series of parliament committee hearings including with Facebook staffers.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s tough new data protection framework, GDPR, only came into force this May &#8212; so the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cambridge-analytica" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cambridge-analytica">Cambridge Analytica <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> breach is being handled under the bloc&#8217;s prior data protection framework, comprising a patchwork of Member State laws.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/uk-watchdog-hands-facebook-500k-fine/">earlier today</a> a fine handed to Facebook for this breach by the UK data watchdog was upheld. The £500k penalty is the maximum possible fine under the country&#8217;s prior data protection regime.</p>
<p>In the new resolution, MEPs have suggested the data obtained by Cambridge Analytica may have been used for political purposes, by both sides in the UK referendum on membership of the EU and to target voters during the 2016 US presidential election &#8212; describing it as a matter of urgency that electoral laws be adapted to take account of digital campaigning. (Clearly with an eye on the upcoming EU elections, next May.)</p>
<p>To combat electoral meddling via social media, MEPs are proposing:</p>
<ul>
<li>applying conventional “off-line” electoral safeguards online: rules on spending transparency and limits, respect for silence periods and equal treatment of candidates;</li>
<li>making it easy to recognise online political paid advertisements and the organisation behind them;</li>
<li>banning profiling for electoral purposes, including use of online behaviour that may reveal political preferences;</li>
<li>that social media platforms should label content shared by bots, speed up the process of removing fake accounts and work with independent fact-checkers and academia to tackle disinformation;</li>
<li>investigations should be carried out by member states with the support of Eurojust, into alleged misuse of the online political space by foreign forces.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the UK a parliamentary committee also recently urged the government to prioritize updating electoral law to take account of digital risks to democratic processes. Although the government has so far only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/fake-news-threat-to-democracy-gets-back-burner-response-from-uk-govt/">taken a cautious approach</a>, saying it&#8217;s still gathering evidence via a series of reviews into different aspects of the issue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Facebook has been rolling out its own system of checks on political advertisers in certain regions &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/facebook-rolls-out-checks-for-uk-political-ads/">the UK</a>.  Though MEPs evidently believe the company needs to go further.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s DPA also previously called for an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/11/facebook-under-fresh-political-pressure-as-uk-watchdog-calls-for-ethical-pause-of-ad-ops/">ethical pause on political microtargeting via online platforms</a>, saying it had a number of concerns about how data is being used and potentially misused.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/xiaomi" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="xiaomi">Xiaomi <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has <a href="http://blog.mi.com/en/2018/10/25/news-technology-meets-art-xiaomi-launches-flagship-mi-mix-3-at-the-forbidden-city/">announced</a> the newest version of its bezel-less Mi Mix family, and it doesn&#8217;t sport a notch like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/31/xiaomis-mi-8-may-be-its-most-brazen-iphone-copycat-yet/">its Mi 8 flagship.</a> Indeed, unlike the Mi 8 &#8212; which I called one of Xiaomi&#8217;s most brazen Apple clones &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot more to get excited about.</p>
<p>The Mi Mix 3 was unveiled at an event in Beijing and, like its predecessor, Xiaomi boasts that it offers a full front screen. Rather than opting for the near-industry standard notch, Xiaomi has developed a slider that houses its front-facing camera. Vivo and Oppo have done similar using a motorized approach, but Xiaomi&#8217;s is magnetic while it can also be programmed for functions such as answering calls.</p>
<p>That array gives it a claimed 93.4 percent screen-to-body ratio and a full 6.4-inch 1080p AMOLED display. The slider, by the way, is good for 300,000 cycles, according to Xiaomi&#8217;s lab testing.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/xiaomi-unveils-concept-phone-with-near-bezel-less-display/">The device itself follows the much-lauded Mi Mix aesthetic</a> with a Snapdragon 845 processor and up to 10GB in RAM (!) in the highest-end model. Xiaomi puts plenty of emphasis on cameras. The Mi Mix 3 includes four of them: a 24-megapixel front camera paired with a two-megapixel sensor and on the back, like the Mi 8, a dual camera array with two 12-megapixel cameras.</p>
<p>Xiaomi has also snuck an &#8216;AI button&#8217; on the left side of the phone, a first for the company. That awakens its Xiao Ai voice assistant, but since it only supports Chinese don&#8217;t expect to see that on worldwide models.</p>

<p>The 10GB version &#8212; made in partnership with Palace Museum, located at the Forbidden City where the device was launched &#8212; also packs 256GB of onboard storage and is priced at RMB 4,999, or $720. That&#8217;s in addition to a ceramic design that Xiaomi says is inspired by the museum&#8230; better that than a fruity-sounding U.S. company.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the special model, and the more affordable options include 6GB + 128GB for RMB 3,299 ($475), 8GB +128G for RMB 3,599 ($520) and 8GB + 256GB for RMB 3,999 ($575). The company also plans to introduce a 5G version in Europe sometime early next year.</p>
<p>Xiaomi said the phones will go on sale in China from 1 November, there&#8217;s no word on international availability or pricing right now.</p>
