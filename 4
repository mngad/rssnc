				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Singapore&#8217;s <a href="http://goldengate.vc/">Golden Gate Ventures</a> has announced the close of its newest (and third) fund for Southeast Asia at a total of $100 million.</p>
<p>The fund hit a first close in the summer, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/31/golden-gate-ventures-hits-first-close-on-new-100m-fund-for-southeast-asia/">as TechCrunch reported at the time</a>, and now it has reached full capacity. Seven-year-old Golden Gate said its LPs include existing backers Singapore sovereign fund Temasek, Korea&#8217;s Hanwha, Naver &#8212; the owner of messaging app Line &#8212; and EE Capital. Investors backing the firm for the first time through this fund include Mistletoe &#8212; the fund from Taizo Son, brother of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son &#8212; Mitsui Fudosan, IDO Investments, CTBC Group, Korea Venture Investment Corporation (KVIC), and Ion Pacific.</p>
<p>Golden Gate was founded by former Silicon Valley-based trio <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/vinnie-lauria" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="vinnie-lauria">Vinnie Lauria, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/jeffrey-paine" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="jeffrey-paine">Jeffrey Paine <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/paul-bragiel" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="paul-bragiel">Paul Bragiel <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. It has investments across five markets in Southeast Asia &#8212; with a particular focus on Indonesia and Singapore &#8212; and that portfolio includes Singapore&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/13/carousell-raises-85m/">Carousell</a>, automotive marketplace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/13/carro-raises-60m/">Carro</a>, P2P lending startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/17/funding-societies-a-southeast-asian-lending-platform-gets-25m-series-b-led-by-softbank-ventures-korea/">Funding Societies</a>, payment enabler <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/20/omise-lands-17-5m-series-b-to-expand-its-stripe-like-service-in-southeast-asia/">Omise</a> and health tech startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/alodokter">Alodokter</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/14/golden-gate-ventures-closes-new-60-million-fund-for-southeast-asia/">Golden Gate&#8217;s previous fund was $60 million</a> and it closed in 2016.</p>
<p>Some of the firm&#8217;s exits so far include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/01/alibaba-lazada-redmart-confirmed/">the sale of Redmart to Lazada</a> (although not a blockbuster), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/24/taipei-based-startup-woomoo-acqui-hired-by-priceline/">Priceline’s acquisition of Woomoo</a>, <a href="https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/business/line-acquires-indonesian-startup-temanjalan">Line’s acquisition of Temanjalan</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/14/go-jek-buys-three-startups-to-advance-its-mobile-payment-business/">the sale of Mapan (formerly Ruma) to Go-Jek</a>. It claims that its first two funds have had distributions of cash (DPI) of 1.56x and 0.13x, and IRRs of 48 percent and 29 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I compare the tech ecosystem of Southeast Asia (SEA) to other markets, it’s really hit an inflection point &#8212; annual investment is now measured in the billions. That puts SEA on a global stage with the US, China, and India. Yet there is a youthfulness that reminds me of Silicon Valley circa 2005, shortly before social media and the iPhone took off,&#8221; Lauria said in a statement.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/12/google-southeast-asias-internet-economy-is-growing-faster-than-expected/">A report from Google and Temasek forecasts</a> that Southeast Asia&#8217;s digital economy will grow from $50 billion in 2017 to over $200 billion by 2025 as internet penetration continues to grow across the region thanks to increased ownership of smartphones. That opportunity to reach a cumulative population of over 600 million consumers &#8212; more of whom are online today than the entire U.S. population &#8212; is feeding optimism around startups and tech companies.</p>
<p>Golden Gate isn&#8217;t alone in developing a fund to explore those possibilities, there&#8217;s plenty of VC activity in the region.</p>
<p>Some of those include Openspace, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/25/singapore-nsi-ventures-is-now-opensapce/">formerly known as NSI Ventures</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/14/openspace-ventures-closes-135m-fund/">just closed a $135 million fund</a>, Qualgro, which is<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/21/qualgro-100-million-fund/"> raising a $100 million vehicle</a> and Golden Equator, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/15/gec-kip-fund-southeast-asia-88-million/">paired up with Korea Investment Partners on a joint $88 million fund.</a> Temasek-affiliated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/10/vertex-ventures-210-million-southeast-asia-india/">Vertex closed a $210 million fund</a> last year and that remains a record for Southeast Asia.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/10/golden-gate-ventures-lunex-crypto/">Golden Gate also has a dedicated crypto fund</a>, LuneX, which is in the process of raising $10 million.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt, regulator <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/jina-choi" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="jina-choi">Jina Choi, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> who heads the SEC&#8217;s wide-reaching San Francisco unit, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/the-sec-has-never-been-busier-investigating-both-private-and-public-companies-in-the-bay-area-suggests-agency-head/">declined to confirm or deny</a> that the SEC is investigating Tesla CEO Elon Musk for possible fraud.</p>
<p>Said Choi, &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you about any particular investigation in our office. And I can&#8217;t confirm or deny the existence of investigations that are in our office. I can say that we are very diligent about covering the issuers in our region and some of the more high-profile issuers in our region. We try to stay on top of that, but that&#8217;s about all I can say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, investor James Anderson of the global asset manager <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-stake/saudi-sovereign-fund-builds-3-to-5-percent-stake-in-tesla-ft-idUSKBN1KS1UG">Baillie Gifford</a> tells Reuters that, as a shareholder, he was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-musk-investor/tesla-investor-says-sec-asked-it-about-funding-secured-tweet-idUSKCN1LS2RD">recently questioned</a> by U.S. securities regulators about Musk’s famous &#8212; and possibly fateful &#8212; early August tweet that he was thinking of taking Tesla private and that he had &#8220;funding secured.&#8221;</p>
<p>Said Anderson to Reuters, &#8220;I don’t know what they’ll do with [Musk], but there’s no implication that we’ve done anything wrong . . . I think quite naturally they wanted to know whether major shareholders had any lead indication or knowledge of the tweet about ‘funding secured.’”</p>
<p>Because it isn&#8217;t talking, it&#8217;s impossible to know how seriously the SEC is looking into the chain of events that led to the tweet or what followed. As industry watchers likely know, days after making his surprising announcement, Musk <a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-saudi-fund-asked-about-taking-tesla-private-1534166024">elaborated</a> on why he made it, <a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/update-taking-tesla-private?mod=article_inline">writing in a </a><a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/update-taking-tesla-private">post</a> that he&#8217;d left a late July meeting with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund that gave him the impression that a deal to take Tesla private could close.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/public-bravado-private-doubts-how-elon-musks-tesla-plan-unraveled-1535326249">tick-tock account</a> by the WSJ of what happened behind the scenes during this period &#8212;  it was published shortly after Musk abandoned his take-private idea &#8212; said officials in the kingdom were &#8220;rankled&#8221; by the suggestion that the Saudis, who have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-stake/saudi-sovereign-fund-builds-3-to-5-percent-stake-in-tesla-ft-idUSKBN1KS1UG">quietly acquired up to 5 percent</a> of Tesla&#8217;s shares this year, had made any kind of formal proposal.</p>
<p>Bruised feelings aside, Musk, it&#8217;s now plain, may be dealing with regulatory fall-out, too. And interestingly, much of what happens next may center not just on interviews with shareholders and Musk&#8217;s other communications, but on plain-old psychology.</p>
<p>Onstage, we asked Choi if, typically speaking, false statements are enough to prove fraud or whether there needs to be an accompanying scheme. &#8220;When you talk about fraud,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;you&#8217;re talking about a state of mind, you&#8217;re talking about mens rea. We call it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scienter">scienter</a>. You have to do something with intentionality. The idea of just making a misstatement doesn&#8217;t necessarily rise to the level of fraud. I think that&#8217;s what makes our investigations so challenging. I think the idea of trying to understand what&#8217;s in people&#8217;s heads can be very difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>Misstatements can &#8220;be the first step to fraud,&#8221; Choi had added. &#8220;But generally, when we talk about fraud the F word, I think we are talking about a state of mind that&#8217;s a little bit higher than that.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nintendo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nintendo">Nintendo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is at last (at last!) bringing some new content to the Switch! Yes!</p>
<p>In a Nintendo Direct, the company let fly a number of games and a couple of original titles. The biggest Nintendo-produced titles we had glimpses of are a new Animal Crossing in development for the Switch and Luigi&#8217;s Mansion 3.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-1712388 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-13-at-4.48.23-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="375" /></p>
<p>We learned next to nothing about the new Animal Crossing, other than that it&#8217;s coming in 2019, but we did get to see some gameplay from the latest chapter of Luigi&#8217;s only titular adventure in the Nintendo world. Luigi&#8217;s Mansion 3 seems to follow in the ghost-vacuuming footsteps of its predecessors with the bizarre camera angles and all. It&#8217;s also heading to the Switch stage in 2019, setting up a couple of Nintendo titles for us to look forward to next year, possibly alongside Metroid Prime 4 (?).</p>
<p>Other familiar additions to the Switch include a port of the Wii U game New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe coming in January and Yoshi’s Crafted World coming in spring 2019.</p>

<p>Aside from the Nintendo-made titles, fans were served up a big surprise with the announcement that some recent and old-school Final Fantasy titles are coming to the Switch. Final Fantasy VII, IX, X, X-2 HD Remaster and XII are all arriving in 2019.</p>
<p>There are about a dozen other incoming titles (several of which are remasters), including EA SPORTS FIFA 19, Starlink: Battle for Atlas, Diablo III: Eternal Collection, Mega Man 11, Katamari Damacy REROLL and plenty of others that you can jump through in the Direct below.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/CRuHg1dv8MI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch is a fantastic system, and while it has a lot going for it, I barely have any games to play for it anymore. It&#8217;s not all that out of character for Nintendo to delay the hell out of the instant gratification its customers want, but the Switch has had a particularly stuttered content rollout since its launch. Hopefully the company can pick up a little more consistent cadence as it gets more third-party studios onboard.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The news that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nintendo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nintendo">Nintendo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> would be adding NES games to the Switch as part of its paid online service had a mixed reception, but the company has completely made up for this controversial decision by releasing wireless NES controllers with which to play those games. At $60 they&#8217;re a bit steep, but come on. You know you&#8217;re going to buy them eventually. Probably next week.</p>
<p>The controllers were revealed during the latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/nintendo-direct/09-13-2018/">Nintendo Direct video news</a> dump, alongside a host of other nostalgia bombs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/13/nintendo-finally-announces-some-more-new-games-for-the-switch/">like a new Animal Crossing and about a million Final Fantasy ports</a>. But first the details of those sweet, sweet controllers.</p>
<p><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712379" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/controllerhero.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="534" />They&#8217;re definitely NES-style down to the buttons, meaning they aren&#8217;t going to replace your existing Switch Joy-Cons. So why do they cost so much? Because Nintendo. At least they&#8217;re wireless and they charge up by slotting onto the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/switch-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="switch-2">Switch&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> sides like Joy-Cons. And they <em>do</em> have shoulder buttons, though, for some reason.</p>
<p><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712358" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/controllers2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="614" />You&#8217;ll be able to pre-order a two-pack starting on the 18th for $60, which also happens to be the launch date for Nintendo Switch Online. Yeah, it&#8217;s time to fork out for that online play Nintendo has generously given away for so long.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as you may remember <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/07/nintendo-switch-online-costs-20-per-year-and-comes-with-20-online-playable-nes-games/">from previous announcements</a>, the cost is pretty low; $20 per year, and it gets you online game access and a growing library of NES classics. Ten of those games were confirmed before, but 10 more were added to the list today.</p>
<p><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712360" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/nintendo-online.png" alt="" width="1024" height="502" />So at launch you&#8217;ll be able to play:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Balloon Fight</em></li>
<li><em>Dr Mario</em></li>
<li><em>Mario Bros.</em></li>
<li><em>Super Mario Bros.</em></li>
<li><em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em></li>
<li><em>Donkey Kong</em></li>
<li><em>Ice Climber</em></li>
<li><em>The Legend of Zelda</em></li>
<li><em>Tennis</em></li>
<li><em>Soccer</em></li>
<li><em>Baseball</em></li>
<li><em>Double Dragon</em></li>
<li><em>Excitebike</em></li>
<li><em>Ghosts &#8216;n Goblins</em></li>
<li><em>Gradius</em></li>
<li><em>Ice Hockey</em></li>
<li><em>Pro Wrestling</em></li>
<li><em>River City Ransom</em></li>
<li><em>Tecmo Bowl</em></li>
<li><em>Yoshi</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The service will also enable cloud backups of saves and possible special deals down the line. It sounds like it&#8217;s basically a must-have, although plenty of people are angry that their virtual console games have been essentially stolen back from them. At least we have the NES and SNES Classic Editions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/12/iphone-xr-up-close-and-hands-on/">iPhone XR</a> arrived like an afterthought. No surprise, really. Apple’s always been one to lead with its best foot forward — the latest, greatest and, quite literally, the largest. Projecting the life on the bleeding edge is a cornerstone of the company’s image, market share and stock price. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The iPhone XR isn’t that. In the context of yesterday’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/12/everything-apple-announced-at-its-iphone-xs-event/">event</a>, the handset is an also ran. It’s lower-powered, with a single camera and lower-resolution screen that stirred up criticism amongst display enthusiasts online. It’s also precisely the phone the company needed to make — and Apple’s going to sell a crapload of them as a result. In fact, I wouldn’t be too surprised to see this entry-level device outsell both of its premium brethren. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over the last 24 hours, a number of folks have asked me which phone they should buy. The answer varies from person to person, of course, but for the majority, the XR simply makes the most sense. It is, as I wrote in my hands-on yesterday, the iPhone X for the rest of us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last year’s 10th anniversary handset pushed the limits of the iPhone, with regard to underlying technology, design and budget. It represented what was arguably the biggest leap for the line since the introduction of the App Store way back in 2008, while helping to break on the $1,000 smartphone.</span></p>
<p><img class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1711256" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_3129.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We all knew things were heading that way, and companies like Samsung certainly gave Apple a run for its money, but the iPhone X really tested the limits of what consumers are willing to spend on a smartphone. Initial sales reports were less than ideal for the phone, though a much pricier phone meant, naturally, that Apple had to sell fewer to hit the same bottom line. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Apple isn’t Vertu. Actually getting the product into consumers’ hands is an equally important aspect of selling a new phone. Early reports had the company eye a return to the LCD as a way of offsetting the phone’s cost in order to appeal to a broader audience. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As The Wall Street Journal put it back in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-x-pensive-apple-looks-to-keep-phones-with-cheaper-displays-1529051835">June</a>, demand “is likely to be slower than many in the industry believed a year ago, when the iPhone maker was preparing its first OLED smartphone.” For Apple, a return to the LCD likely felt like a step backward after releasing its most forward-looking phone. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But while such things do matter to some, technology refreshes are more often driven by the desire to stay a step ahead of the competition than they are consumer demand. And while having the highest resolution screen possible would certainly be nice, it’s not necessarily $1,000 worth of nice. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The iPhone XR represents a more balanced approach for Apple. But atop the foundation of the iPhone X, the handset manages to be relatively reasonably priced without being the sort of relic the iPhone 8 felt like it was announced alongside the X.</span></p>
[gallery ids="1711261,1711262,1711257,1711256,1711254"]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The XR is the populist iPhone. The iPhone for the people. I’ve been calling it the iPod Mini of iPhones and Matt Burns has been saying it’s the iBook, but the point stands. It’s a cheaper, more colorful alternative. At least one of our co-workers has been obsessing slightly over which color to get. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At $749, it’s not cheap, but compared to the XS and XS Max (starting at $999 and $1,099, respectively), it’s a relative bargain, and most of the missing features won’t have an impact on the day to day use of an average user. Heck, even the single lens camera has learned to approximate portrait mode to further cushion the blow. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If I were in the market for a new iPhone, I’d almost certainly go the XR route. Listen, I’m a tech blogger living in New York City. I have a pet rabbit to feed. Do you think rabbit food grows on trees (I mean, technically it does, but you get the point). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’re a prospective iPhone buyer, you’re probably in the same boat. The XR’s the way to go, and Apple’s going to sell a ton of the things. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A nasty legal battle is set to play out between two former <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> executives.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/eric-alexander" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="eric-alexander">Eric Alexander, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the ride-hailing company&#8217;s former president of business in Asia-Pacific, has filed suit against former Uber PR chief <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/rachel-whetstone" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="rachel-whetstone">Rachel Whetstone <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Alexander blames Whetstone for his firing from Uber in June 2017, claiming her &#8220;grossly misleading statements&#8221; both internally at Uber and to the media, &#8220;destroyed his reputation.&#8221; He claims she &#8220;harbored deep seated personal animosity&#8221; against him, was jealous of his close relationship with then-CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/travis-kalanick" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="travis-kalanick">Travis Kalanick <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and frequently made racist comments about several minority groups during her tenure.</p>
<p>Whetstone, well-known in Silicon Valley for her comms prowess, also left Uber in 2017 and has since gone on to lead PR efforts at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/27/rachel-whetstone-facebook-netflix/">and now Netflix</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Whetstone, Alexander and Uber for comment.</p>
<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>Last year, Alexander was very publicly ousted from Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/07/uber-exec-is-out-after-violating-riders-privacy/">after obtaining the medical records of a female passenger who was raped by an Uber driver</a> in India. Alexander had reportedly been investigating the case himself because he believed the Indian ride-hailing business Ola was behind the incident and that the competitor was trying to damage Uber&#8217;s reputation in India.</p>
<p>Alexander spent just over three years at the company and was a close confidant of Kalanick&#8217;s.</p>

Given the contentious relationship between the parties, upon her severance from Uber, Ms. Whetstone took the unusual step of insisting on a reciprocal non-disparagement clause that specifically referenced Mr. Alexander by name. Ms. Whetstone thereafter proceeded to violate that clause by spreading false and misleading and/or disparaging information about Mr. Alexander&#8217;s response to the rape in India. Ms. Whetstone&#8217;s derogatory statements were made in direct violation of the non-disparagement.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The lawsuit provides several examples of racist comments allegedly made by Whetstone, including that &#8220;the Chinese cannot be trusted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alexander says Whetstone also went to reporters &#8212; Bloomberg&#8217;s Eric Newcomer and Recode&#8217;s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/kara-swisher" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="kara-swisher">Kara Swisher <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> were named specifically &#8212; and told them &#8220;false and misleading information.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Uber&#8217;s past catches up to it</h2>
<p>The lawsuit, for the most part, looks to be an attempt on Alexander&#8217;s end to clear his name. According to his LinkedIn, he hasn&#8217;t pursued any new opportunities since his well-publicized exit from Uber, and that&#8217;s likely not for lack of trying.</p>
<p>As for Uber, despite replacing its CEO and several other top-level employees following its no good, very bad year in 2017, the company hasn&#8217;t been able to shake its scandal-ridden reputation. The mistakes made under Kalanick&#8217;s reign have and will continue to catch up to it. And nothing, not even a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/12/uber-is-getting-a-new-look/">rebrand</a>, can stop that.</p>

<p>Katrina Jones, who will start next month as Twitch&#8217;s head of diversity and inclusion, is the former head of diversity at Vimeo. At Vimeo, Jones created the <a href="https://vimeo.com/blog/post/diversity-and-inclusion-at-vimeo">company&#8217;s diversity strategy</a>, and worked on disrupting bias and fostering inclusion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/michelle-weaver-2" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="michelle-weaver-2">Michelle Weaver <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Sudarshana Rangachary are coming on board as CFO and CHRO, respectively.</p>
<p>From the diversity and inclusion front, Twitch has a history of struggling. The platform itself, for example, <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/06/twitch-diversity.html">was called out in 2015 for being mostly white and male</a>.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2016, and Twitch hosted a panel at its annual convention dubbed &#8220;Diversify Twitch.&#8221; That didn&#8217;t turn out very well for Twitch, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/10/6/13176706/twitchcon-racism">as its African-American panelists were subjected to racism, insults and slurs</a>. Just last year, Twitch hosted a site-wide &#8220;holiday&#8221; to celebrate diversity and inclusion on its streams, chats, apps and community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last few months haven’t been easy for crypto investors. Following the dizzying highs of crypto trading late last year, which saw <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bitcoin" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bitcoin">Bitcoin <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> reach a peak of $19,276 and a market cap of $323 billion and Ether reach $1,152 with a market cap of more than $112 billion, prices have crashed. Today, Bitcoin trades at around $6,500, and Ether at $204. Their combined market caps have shed about $300 billion in value.</p>
<p>That’s basically five Bernie Madoffs worth of losses.</p>
<p>The situation has put crypto investors in quite the bind. As one indicative example, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/olaf-carlson-wee-rode-the-bitcoin-boom-to-silicon-valley-riches-can-he-survive-the-crash-1536681364">The Wall Street Journal profiled wunderkind crypto investor Olaf Carlson-Wee</a>, who founded Polychain Capital. The fund, which has seen dizzying growth over the past few years turning a few thousand dollars into tens of millions in returns, has lost about 40 percent of its $800 million in capital through investment losses and investor withdrawals.</p>
<p>It’s clear the second blockchain bubble is now complete (the first was the run-up in Bitcoin prices in 2013). The question is: What’s next for blockchain?</p>
<h2>Blockchain’s two narratives&#8217; problem</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/21/blockchain-valley-of-despair/">I have previously argued</a> that blockchain’s rise is a dual parallel to that of the internet. On one side that I dubbed the 1960s narrative, the technology is extraordinarily nascent, with limited use cases and almost no ability to scale. The other side is the 1990s narrative — that this is a groundbreaking new technology that should be invested in immediately for maximum returns.</p>
<p>Blockchain’s story so far is the freakish combination of these two narratives. The enthusiasm of the “1990s” crypto investors on valuation never matched the enthusiasm of the “1960s” crowd of crypto researchers and core blockchain designers, who focused on the potential of these technologies over the vagaries of price. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHMjbsKN1p4">As conversations with leaders like Vitalik Buterin can attest</a>, many of the core engineers are hyper-aware of just how much work remains to be done to see blockchain become a foundational technology.</p>
<p>Indeed, the interaction between these two groups explains much of the kerfuffle this week over <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-08/crypto-growth-nears-ceiling-ethereum-co-founder-buterin-says">Buterin’s comments around the lack of “1000x” potential with blockchain</a>. While the media has painted his comments in a deeply negative light, and he has been <a href="https://ethereumworldnews.com/joseph-lubin-disagrees-vitalik-buterin-much-growth-ahead-crypto/">criticized by crypto acolytes</a>, I think it is clear that his pragmatism stems from his engineering background rather than his investment focus.</p>
<p>The simple answer is that the 1960s crowd is right, and the 1990s crowd is just too early. Much more development is needed to get blockchain where it needs to be, and much more analysis is going to have to be done to figure out where the investment returns are going to be. Search and social ended up being the killer apps for the internet, but the winners in those categories hardly emerged instantly.</p>
<h2>Real innovation is slower than we always expect</h2>
<p><a href="https://singularityhub.com/2016/03/22/technology-feels-like-its-accelerating-because-it-actually-is/">The pace of innovation may have accelerated over the past two centuries</a>, but there is still a ceiling on how fast things can change. The cell phone took almost two decades from its original launch in the 1980s to the launch of the iPhone in 2007. The internet took roughly three decades from its conception at ARPA to what we now understand as the world wide web.</p>
<p>Blockchain is almost certainly on a similar timeline. While the tech has antecedents going back to the digital gold of the 1990s, we can start the clock with the launch of Bitcoin in 2009. That means we aren’t even finished with the first decade of understanding this technology, building up a theory of how it works, or thinking through its use cases in a scalable way. In short, there is so much more work to be done to harness this tech for our own purposes.</p>
<p>The good news is that the massive infusion of investment from crypto traders over the past few years should help to rapidly accelerate blockchain’s development. Some of these projects, which wouldn’t have gotten funding even from a university laboratory, are sitting on a ridiculous level of seed funding. They could create a lot of progress in this space, assuming that these projects use their funds effectively.</p>
<p>The downside to the onrush of capital is that morale has certainly been shaken for many participants, and morale is critical to seeing through complex new projects to completion. There are going to be ups and downs with the design of any new technology on the frontier of engineering — but morale and stubbornness can do a lot to keep the momentum up.</p>
<h2>Where should we focus?</h2>
<p>To me, several veins of research and development around blockchain remain deeply exciting, if we have the patience to see them through. They are:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li><b>Identity</b><strong>:</strong> I’ve written about projects like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/11/element-identity/">Element</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/07/learning-machine-credentials/">Learning Machines</a> before. There are incredible challenges around how to offer portable and secure identities to every human on earth, to say nothing of every animal and physical object. Blockchain seems like technology that might be able to help here, if we are able to figure how to connect the digital world to the analog one. Facebook was once considered to be the identity layer of the internet &#8212; a claim that it has failed to live up to. Blockchain may ultimately arrive to complete that mission.</li>
<li><b>Decentralized web</b><strong>:</strong> I was fortunate to catch up with Jutta Steiner of Parity Technologies last week at TechCrunch Disrupt and also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/06/paritys-jutta-steiner-says-the-future-of-blockchain-is-many-chains-working-together/">host her at our event in Zug this past July</a>. She and others like Gavin Wood have done a lot of work to start thinking through how chains can interact, as well as how to rebuild our modern web infrastructure in a decentralized way. Their ideas — like everything in this new world — are very early and inchoate, but they are inspiring in their potential. While centralized servers have huge performance advantages over decentralized technologies today, there’s no reason why that gap has to be permanent. <a href="https://web3.foundation">Web3</a> and other projects could lead the way to pushing this model forward.</li>
<li><b>Security Tokens</b><strong>:</strong> Can blockchain technologies help us build a safer, more efficient financial system? I am reminded of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-05-13/t-rowe-price-voted-for-the-dell-buyout-by-accident">the piece by Matt Levine of Bloomberg on the shareholder votes to take Dell private</a> and the massive level of indirection and complication it illuminated when it comes to ownership in our modern economy. Security tokens could provide a means to manage that complexity in a much more fluid way, particularly in a world where sharing is increasingly the norm around fixed assets (autos and Uber, homes and Airbnb, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>I use “may” and “could” for each of these examples because we have no idea what we are going to discover on the frontier of blockchain. The good news is that these are rich directions to investigate, and even if we don’t discover something specifically in these areas, we are likely to discover <i>something</i> that moves the technologies forward along the way.</p>
<p>All this is to say that we need to stop reading the latest token prices every 10 minutes, and get back to the real work of building up this new technology and turning it into the revolution it one day could be.</p>

<p>Looking for funding as a startup in Latin America is a lot like looking for a watering hole in the middle of the desert. You know it’s out there, but finding it in time is a life or death situation.</p>
<p>Granted, venture capital investment in the region is at an <a href="https://lavca.org/industry-data/inside-latin-americas-breakout-year-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://lavca.org/industry-data/inside-latin-americas-breakout-year-tech/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1536687469425000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGmBAVedYhbuix9EQWvBbn2TPGZeg">all-time high</a>, with leading firms like Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners having made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/global-tech-firms-and-investors-are-reshaping-latin-americas-startup-environment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/global-tech-firms-and-investors-are-reshaping-latin-americas-startup-environment/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1536687469425000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHSOa3QENVBgmNvVot8R1EiLEJF6w">inaugural investments</a> in markets like Colombia, Brazil and Mexico, respectively. But, at the same time, while startup founders might be tantalized by the news of big investments happening around them, as many of them get closer to the funding stage themselves, they often realize it’s nothing but a mirage.</p>
<p>And this isn’t just a problem in Latin America. All over the world, startups are struggling to find investment, as VCs are investing more money in fewer deals in the endless search for the next unicorn. Due to a dwindling number of VC deals in both the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/30/theres-an-implosion-of-early-stage-vc-funding-and-no-ones-talking-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/30/theres-an-implosion-of-early-stage-vc-funding-and-no-ones-talking-about-it/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1536687469425000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHkB1KRPGPmLMInNFiUlDgI0b6XmA">United States</a> and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/845f5cb0-0c19-11e8-839d-41ca06376bf2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.ft.com/content/845f5cb0-0c19-11e8-839d-41ca06376bf2&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1536687469425000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQUL6D-n2Vg3163ufyyrSUdVKuLQ">Europe</a>, even entrepreneurs in established ecosystems are having to look further afield for the resources they need to build their businesses, bringing many of them to emerging markets like Latin America.</p>
<p>Fortunately, whether you’re a local or foreign founder in an emerging market, there is a way to quench your thirst for the international investment that you need to scale your company. Here’s what we recommend to the startups that are part of our UTEC Ventures accelerator program in Peru, and what we’d recommend to you, too.</p>
<h2>Find local seed money first</h2>
<p>As a startup in an emerging market, the prospect of finding local investment can seem challenging. In fact, this is probably why you’re looking for international investment in the first place. But the truth is, finding local seed money to get started is really the first prerequisite for securing international funding later on.</p>
<p>Last year in Peru, for example, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xf-oJUHdPu6UOKfrcXLRyma7bG6IX60U/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xf-oJUHdPu6UOKfrcXLRyma7bG6IX60U/view&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1536687469425000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFhUHTJbibJ6wWD-z1q5BHcHyV3zQ">US$7.2 million of seed capital</a> was invested in the country’s startups, with barely over US$1 million coming from international funds. This goes to show that international investors peeking into emerging markets are less active in seed rounds, and more interested in later-stage rounds once a company has better demonstrated its worth.</p>
	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--center">
		<blockquote>
			If you want to attract international investors, you need to be an international startup.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	
<p>As such, we advise all startups to raise a first or second seed round locally in Peru, and then seek international investors. The same can go for other emerging markets, as well.</p>
<p>To raise these initial rounds, the most important thing is to show that you have a solid team, a business idea that works and has traction with clients chasing your product and that you’re better than any local competition. If you can demonstrate that you meet these requirements, finding local seed capital shouldn’t be too difficult; all you need is a good pitch deck and some patience when networking within local angel groups or at investor events.</p>
<h2>Replicate success in a bigger, more competitive market</h2>
<p>If you want to attract international investors, you need to be an international startup. In other words, you need to demonstrate that you can sell your product in a bigger, more competitive market before turning the heads of international investors. For startups in Peru and other emerging markets in Latin America, that means successfully expanding to the region’s most developed markets in Mexico, Brazil or Argentina.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the Colombian courier service Rappi. It wasn’t until after the company expanded its operations to Mexico at the beginning of 2016 that it secured its <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rappi" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rappi&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1536687469425000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFCe3V5L-6TwrBUACcnwiPEYQWfGw">first major international investment,</a> led by Andreessen Horowitz. The company then went on to close a Series B round just <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_188844976"><span class="aQJ">one month later</span></span>, in addition to a US$130 million venture round at the beginning of this year, led by a German food delivery service with participation from a number of U.S.-based investors.</p>
<p>The same idea goes for emerging markets outside of Latin America, too. In Eastern Europe, which <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/309205" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/309205&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1536687469425000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEB8Pv01fa6bNR8Jq7UiKGuz-C6Xw">lags behind its western counterpart</a> in terms of VC funding, many entrepreneurs will either set up their businesses in Western European countries from the get-go, or expand there as soon as they’ve achieved product/market fit and demonstrated success in their home countries.</p>
<p>This is a clear demonstration of the broader fact that if you want to start raising money from more developed markets, you generally need to be based in those markets, or at least a market of comparable size. Accordingly, your primary focus when seeking international funding should be to first succeed locally, and then replicate that success in a more developed market &#8212; whether that be in the United States, Mexico, Western Europe or anywhere else.</p>
<h2>Remember, not all international funding comes from international VCs</h2>
<p>While it’s easy to be distracted by the glitz and glamour of securing a round from international VCs, startups have a number of other options at their disposal to secure international funding.</p>
<p>Foreign governments in emerging markets are increasingly stepping up their game with programs designed to bolster their local startup ecosystems as an engine for economic growth. As such, a number of <a href="https://medium.com/@sangeeta_34640/10-programs-around-the-world-giving-equity-free-money-to-startups-29b678320c3c" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://medium.com/@sangeeta_34640/10-programs-around-the-world-giving-equity-free-money-to-startups-29b678320c3c&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1536687469425000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGe01skabKn8uwBbnoaDQtORu_dig">foreign governmental programs</a> have emerged, offering support in the form of equity-free cash to entrepreneurs who decide to set up shop in a given country.</p>
	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--center">
		<blockquote>
			Corporate capital has taken on a very important role in many emerging markets like Latin America. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	
<p>There are plenty of examples in Latin America alone. <a href="http://www.startupchile.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.startupchile.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1536687469425000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGEya8saWWKStPoDvDySuCEnljgKg">Start-Up Chile</a>, for example, offers entrepreneurs up to US$80,000 to launch their businesses in Chile as a launch pad to reach the rest of the world; <a href="https://www.parallel18.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.parallel18.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1536687469425000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE7xOQ3_PXL19ZhRpOyTTqzUuJBQw">Parallel18</a> in Puerto Rico offers entrepreneurs up to US$75,000 to do the same thing; and the Peruvian government plans to announce a similar program to help startups soft launch in Peru with up to US$40,000 at the upcoming <a href="https://www.peruventurecapitalconference.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.peruventurecapitalconference.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1536687469425000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGIwwH9qm1aovc2_8pZ9FY0gZ6R-Q">Peru Venture Capital Conference</a>.</p>
<p>Startups have another option, as well. Corporate capital, or startup investment from major corporations, has taken on a very important role in many emerging markets like Latin America. In fact, Qualcomm Ventures, the investment arm of U.S.-based tech giant Qualcomm, is the <a href="https://lavca.org/2018/02/26/global-corporate-investors-latam-startups-2013-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://lavca.org/2018/02/26/global-corporate-investors-latam-startups-2013-2017/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1536687469425000&amp;usg=AFQjCNECm-TFAHLFS_6zHkWQRjvo6R4haw">most active global corporate investor</a> in Latin America. Naspers, American Express Ventures and other corporate funds have taken an active interest in the region’s startups, as well.</p>
<p>Together, the growing support of foreign governments and interest from international corporations highlights the fact that securing international funding is in fact possible, and not as hard as you’d expect. Knowing that there are options besides getting an international VC on board, you should take the time to find out which alternatives are available in the markets to which you’re hoping to expand.</p>
<p>So, no matter whether you’re a local or foreign entrepreneur in an emerging market, there’s no reason to give up hope on finding international funding. The key is to think globally and use technology to solve real-world challenges. Then, demonstrate success at home first, and duplicate it later in a bigger market. Resources are available to help you when taking your first step abroad, and if you do it well, you’ll find that the investment wells aren’t dry after all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Watching the current price madness is scary. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bitcoin" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bitcoin">Bitcoin <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is falling and rising in $500 increments with regularity and Ethereum and its attendant ICOs are in a seeming freefall with a few &#8220;dead cat bounces&#8221; to keep things lively. What this signals is not that crypto is dead, however. It signals that the early, elated period of trading whose milestones including the launch of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="coinbase">Coinbase <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and the growth of a vibrant (if often shady) professional ecosystem is over.</p>
<p>Crypto still runs on hype. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/Gemini">Gemini</a> announcing a stablecoin, the World Economic Forum saying something <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-could-boost-trade-finance-by-1-trillion-wef-research-says/">hopeful</a>, someone else saying <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/02/the-collapse-of-eth-is-inevitable/">something less hopeful</a> &#8211; all of these things and more are helping define the current market. However, something else is happening behind the scenes that is far more important.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve written before, the socialization and general acceptance of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial pursuits is a very recent thing. In the old days &#8211; circa 2000 &#8211; building your own business was considered somehow sordid. Chancers who gave it a go were considered get-rich-quick schemers and worth of little more than derision.</p>
<p>As the dot-com market exploded, however, building your own business wasn&#8217;t so wacky. But to do it required the imprimaturs and resources of major corporations &#8211; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Sun, HP, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sybase" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sybase">Sybase, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> etc. &#8211; or a connection to academia &#8211; Google, Netscape, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/yahoo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="yahoo">Yahoo, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> etc. You didn&#8217;t just quit school, buy a laptop, and start Snapchat.</p>
<p>It took a full decade of steady change to make the revolutionary thought that school wasn&#8217;t so great and that money was available for all good ideas to take hold. And take hold it did. We owe the success of TechCrunch and Disrupt to that idea and I&#8217;ve always said that TC was career pornography for the cubicle dweller, a guilty pleasure for folks who knew there was something better out there and, with the right prodding, they knew they could achieve it.</p>
<p>So in looking at the crypto markets currently we must look at the dot-com markets circa 1999. Massive infrastructure changes, some brought about by Y2K, had computerized nearly every industry. GenXers born in the late 70s and early 80s were in the marketplace of ideas with an understanding of the Internet the oldsters at the helm of media, research, and banking didn&#8217;t have. It was a massive wealth transfer from the middle managers who pushed paper since 1950 to the dot-com CEOs who pushed bits with native ease.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today and we see much of the same thing. Blockchain natives boast about having been interest in bitcoin since 2014. Oldsters at banks realize they should get in on things sooner than later and price manipulation is rampant simply because it is easy. The projects we see now are the Kozmo.com of the blockchain era, pie-in-the-sky dream projects that are sucking up millions in funding and will produce little in real terms. But for every hundred Kozmos there is one <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what you have to look for.</p>
<p>Will nearly every <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ico-failure-rate-skyrocketing-2018/">ICO launched in the last few years fail</a>? Yes. Does it matter?</p>
<p>Not much.</p>
<p>The market is currently eating its young. Early investors made (and probably lost) millions on early ICOs but the resulting noise has created an environment where the best and brightest technical minds are faced with not only creating a technical product but also maintaining a monetary system. There is no need for a smart founder to have to worry about token price but here we are. Most technical CEOs step aside or call for outside help after their IPO, a fact that points to the complexity of managing shareholder expectations. But what happens when your shareholders are 16-year-olds with a lot of Ethereum in a Discord channel? What happens when little Malta becomes the de facto launching spot for token sales and you&#8217;re based in Nebraska? What happens when the SEC, FINRA, and Attorneys General from here to Beijing start investigating your hobby?</p>
<p>Basically your hobby stops becoming a hobby. Crypto and blockchain has weaponized nerds in an unprecedented way. In the past if you were a Linux developer or knew a few things about hardware you could build a business and make a little money. Now you can build an empire and make a lot of money.</p>
<p>Crypto is falling because the people in it for the short term are leaving. Long term players &#8211; the Amazons of the space &#8211; have yet to be identified. Ultimately we are going to face a compression in the ICO and, for a while, it&#8217;s going to be a lot harder to build an ICO. But give it a few years &#8211; once the various financial authorities get around to reading the Satoshi white paper &#8211; and you&#8217;ll see a sea change. Coverage will change. Services will change. And the way you raise money will change.</p>
<p>VC used to be about a team and a dream. Now it&#8217;s about a team, $1 million in monthly revenue, and a dream. The risk takers are gone. The dentists from Omaha who once visited accelerator demo days and wrote $25,000 checks for new apps are too shy to leave their offices. The flashy VCs from Sand Hill have to keep <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/airbnb" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="airbnb">Airbnb&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> plates spinning until they can cash out. VC is dead for the small entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Which is why the ICO is so important and this is why the ICO is such a mess right now. Because everybody sees the value but nobody &#8211; not the SEC, not the investors, not the founders &#8211; can understand how to do it right. There is no SAFE note for crypto. There are no serious accelerators. And all of the big names in crypto are either goldbugs, weirdos, or Redditors. No one has tamed the Wild West.</p>
<p>They will.</p>
<p>And when they do expect a whole new crop of Amazons, Ubers, and Oracles. Because the technology changes quickly when there&#8217;s money, talent, and a way to marry the two in which everyone wins.</p>

<p>Lobe was co-founded by <a href="http://www.mikematas.com/#!2Rs/3Z8B/ui_design/instant_articles">Mike Matas</a>, who previously worked on the iPhone and iPad, as well as Facebook&#8217;s Paper and Instant Articles products. The other co-founders are Adam Menges and Markus Beissinger.</p>
<p><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712148" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/OMB-image.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></p>
<p>In addition to Lobe, Microsoft also recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/20/microsoft-is-buying-a-ai-startup-bonsai/">bought Bonsai.ai</a>, a deep reinforcement learning platform, and <a href="http://www.semanticmachines.com/">Semantic Machines</a>, a conversational AI platform. Last year, it acquired Disrupt Battlefield participant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/13/microsoft-acquires-maluuba-a-startup-focused-on-general-artificial-intelligence/">Maluuba</a>. It&#8217;s no secret that machine learning talent is hard to come by, so it&#8217;s no surprise that all of the major tech firms are acquiring as much talent and technology as they can.</p>
<p>&#8220;In many ways though, we’re only just beginning to tap into the full potential AI can provide,&#8221; Microsoft&#8217;s EVP and CTO Kevin Scott writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;This in large part is because AI development and building deep learning models are slow and complex processes even for experienced data scientists and developers. To date, many people have been at a disadvantage when it comes to accessing AI, and we’re committed to changing that.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Lobe&#8217;s approach complements Microsoft&#8217;s existing <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning-studio/">Azure ML Studio platform</a>, which also offers a drag-and-drop interface for building machine learning models, though with a more utilitarian design than the slick interface that the Lobe team built. Both Lobe and Azure ML Studio aim to make machine learning easy to use for anybody, without having to know the ins and outs of TensorFlow, Keras or PyTorch. Those approaches always come with some limitations, but just like low-code tools, they do serve a purpose and work well enough for many use cases.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The incredible agility of the common house or fruit fly puts every drone and robot to shame, but devices inspired by them are beginning to catch up. A new four-winged flapping robot not only successfully imitates the fruit fly&#8217;s hyper-agile flying method, but can travel for up to a kilometer before running out of juice.</p>
<p>Robotics researchers at the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/">Delft University of Technology</a> wanted to create a flying platform that could imitate and test theories on how insects fly the way they do, but without tethers or non-animal propulsion like propellers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just that they want a cool robot: The way insects respond to things like gusts of wind or an imminent slapping hand demonstrate incredible reaction times and control feedback, things that could inform autonomous craft like drones or even small airplanes. Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to know your jet could autonomously and smoothly dodge a lightning bolt?</p>
<p>The trouble is that when you get much bigger than an insect, that method of flying doesn&#8217;t always work any more due to the differences in mass, drag and so on. As the researchers put it in their paper, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aat0350">which made the cover of Science</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because of technological challenges arising from stringent weight and size restrictions, most existing designs cannot match the flight performance of their biological counterparts; they lack the necessary agility, sufficient power to take off, or sufficient energy to fly for more than a minute.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not only that, but tiny robots like the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/25/the-robobee-learns-to-launch-itself-out-of-the-water/">Robobee</a> require a wired power connection, and other tiny flapping craft require manual piloting. Can&#8217;t have that! So rather than slavishly imitate the biology of a single animal, the team focused on how to achieve similar flight characteristics at a realistic scale.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1711434" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/flyguy1.gif" alt="" width="644" height="348" />The four-winged, tailless style of their creation, the DelFly Nimble, is novel but evidently effective. Their robot can go 7 meters per second, or about 15 MPH, hover in place or perform all kinds of extreme motions like dives and rolls smoothly. It&#8217;s no joke doing that using rotors with continuous thrust, let alone via coordinated wing movement. You can see it perform a few more capers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEhu-FePBC0&amp;feature=youtu.be">in the video here</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps most amazing is its range; the robot can travel for a kilometer on a single charge. That sort of spec is the kind that military R&amp;D directors love to hear about.</p>
<p>But the DelFly Nimble is already producing interesting scientific data, as lead researcher Matěj Karásek explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>In contrast to animal experiments, we were in full control of what was happening in the robot&#8217;s &#8216;brain.&#8217; This allowed us to identify and describe a new passive aerodynamic mechanism that assists the flies, but possibly also other flying animals, in steering their direction throughout these rapid banked turns.</p></blockquote>
<p>Development is continuing, and no doubt biologists and three-letter agencies have tendered letters of interest to the Dutch inventors.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a smart display that&#8217;s powered by the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Assistant, you now have two choices: the Lenovo Smart Display and the <a href="https://www.harmanaudio.com/jbl/JBLLINKVIEWBLKAM.html?mrkgcl=989&amp;mrkgadid=3308648391&amp;utm_campaign=Con%7CText%7CProduct%7CJBL&amp;utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=paid-search&amp;utm_term=jbl_link_view&amp;utm_content=LINK+VIEW&amp;adpos=1t1&amp;creative=293200967468&amp;device=c&amp;matchtype=e&amp;network=g&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwlejcBRAdEiwAAbj6KYDDgsFUarCDu9qixX0Rxy-4-Ej1l0KnTrYuxdGHFm7GQxdNXSf7pRoCvtYQAvD_BwE">JBL Link View</a>. Lenovo was first out of the gate with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/review-lenovos-google-smart-display-is-pretty-and-intelligent/">surprisingly stylish gadget</a>, but it also left room for improvement. JBL, given its heritage as an audio company, is putting the emphasis on sound quality, with stereo speakers and a surprising amount of bass.</p>
<p>In terms of the overall design, the Link View isn&#8217;t going to win any prizes, but its pill shape definitely isn&#8217;t ugly either. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/jbl" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="jbl">JBL <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> makes the Link View in any color you like, as long as that&#8217;s black. It&#8217;ll likely fit in with your home decor, though.</p>
<p>The Link View has an 8-inch high-definition touchscreen that is more than crisp enough for the maps, photos and YouTube videos you&#8217;ll play on it. In using it for the last two weeks, the screen turned out to be a bit of a fingerprint magnet, but you&#8217;d expect that given that I put it on the kitchen counter and regularly used it to entertain myself while waiting for the water to boil.</p>
<p><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712082" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/00100dPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20180913100535694_COVER.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="733" /></p>
<p>At the end of the day, you&#8217;re not going to spend $250 on a nice speaker with a built-in tablet. What matters most here is whether the visual side of the Google Assistant works for you. I find that it adds an extra dimension to the audio responses, no matter whether that&#8217;s weather reports, a map of my daily commute (which can change depending on traffic) or a video news report. Google&#8217;s interface for these devices is simple and clear, with large buttons and clearly presented information. And maybe that&#8217;s no surprise. These smart speakers are the ideal surface for its Material Design language, after all.</p>
<p>As a demo, Google likes to talk about how these gadgets can help you while cooking, with step-by-step recipes and videos. I find that this is a nice demo indeed, and thought that it would help me get a bit more creative with trying new recipes. In reality, though, I never have the ingredients I need to cook what Google suggests. If you are a better meal planner than I am, your mileage will likely vary.</p>
<p><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712083" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/00100dPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20180913100702433_COVER.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="639" /></p>
<p>What I find surprisingly useful is the display&#8217;s integration of Google Duo. I&#8217;m aware that the Allo/Duo combo is a bit of a flop, but the display does make you want to use Duo because you can easily have a video chat while just doing your thing in the kitchen. If you set up multiple users, the display can even receive calls for all of them. And don&#8217;t worry, there is a physical slider you can use to shut down the camera whenever you want.</p>
<p>The Link View also made me appreciate Google&#8217;s Assistant routines more (and my colleague Lucas Matney found the same when he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/review-lenovos-google-smart-display-is-pretty-and-intelligent/">tried out the Lenovo Smart Display</a>). And it&#8217;s just a bit easier to look at the weather graphics instead of having the Assistant rattle off the temperature for the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Maybe the biggest letdown, though (and this isn&#8217;t JBL&#8217;s, fault but a feature Google needs to enable) is that you can&#8217;t add a smart display to your Google Assistant groups. That means you can&#8217;t use it as part of your all-house Google Home audio system, for example. It&#8217;s an odd omission for sure, given the Link View&#8217;s focus on sound, but my understanding is that the same holds true for the Lenovo Smart Display. If this is a deal breaker for you, then I&#8217;d hold off on buying a Google Assistant smart display for the time being.</p>
<p><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712084" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/00100dPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20180913100236774_COVER.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="602" /></p>
<p>You can, however, use the display as a Chromecast receiver to play music from your phone or watch videos. While you are not using it, the display can show the current time or simply go to blank.</p>
<p>Another thing that doesn&#8217;t work on smart displays yet is Google&#8217;s continued &#8220;conversation feature,&#8221; which lets you add a second command without having to say &#8220;OK, Google&#8221; again. For now, the smart displays only work in English, too.</p>
<p>When I first heard about these smart displays, I wasn&#8217;t sure if they were going to be useful. Turns out, they are. I do live in the Google Assistant ecosystem, though, and I&#8217;ve got a few Google Homes set up around my house. If you&#8217;re looking to expand your Assistant setup, then the Link View is a nice addition &#8212; and if you&#8217;re just getting started (or only need one Assistant-enabled speaker/display), then opting for a smart display over a smart speaker may just be the way to go, assuming you can stomach the extra cost.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://adobe.com">Adobe</a> could be shopping for another piece of the digital marketing puzzle, as reports surfaced today that the company might be in talks with Vista Equity Partners to buy Marketo, a company the private equity firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/vista-equity-partners-buys-marketo-for-1-8b-in-cash/">purchased in May 2016 for $1.8 billion</a> in cash. Reuters<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-marketo-m-a-adobe-systems-exclusive/exclusive-adobe-in-talks-to-buy-marketing-software-firm-marketo-sources-idUSKCN1LT0EK"> was first to report</a> the rumor.</p>
<p>While the report states the talks are early, and nothing is imminent, and none of the companies involved would comment (understandably), it is a deal that makes sense for Adobe. The company has been trying to build out its digital marketing business for some time, including buying<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/21/adobe-to-acquire-magento-for-1-6-b/"> Magento in May for $1.8 billion</a> to help beef up the ecommerce piece.</p>
<p>Assuming that Vista wants to flip <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/marketo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="marketo">Marketo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for a profit, a good bet, it would likely need to come in at $2 billion at a minimum and probably more. There are only a few companies out there that could afford the price tag, who would be interested in a property like Marketo: Adobe, Salesforce, Microsoft, SAP and Oracle.</p>
<p>If Adobe really wanted to go for the digital marketing jugular, it could fork over the cash and buy Marketo. Brent Leary, who covers this industry as the principle at CRM Essentials, says this would be a way for Adobe to grab a chunk of enterprise marketing automation business at a time when the market is getting highly competitive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marketo would give Adobe a leader in the marketing automation space at the enterprise customer level, particularly in the B2B space.&#8221; Leary explained.</p>
<p>While nothing is clear yet, Adobe has the resources if it wants to do it. The company currently has $6.3 billion in cash on hand, according <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ADBE/key-statistics?p=ADBE">to data on Yahoo finance</a>, and has seen its stock price rise significantly in the last year from $156.24 to $269.58 (as of publication today).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1712078" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-13-13.13.45.png?w=639" alt="" width="639" height="526" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adobe Creative Cloud has always been the primary money maker for Adobe over the years, generating $1.3 billion<a href="https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/investor-relations/pdfs/41608102/atN97Gmaq13lf4BE.pdf"> in the last report</a> (pdf) in June out of $2.2 billion in total revenue. Digital Experience, which includes marketing products, generated $586 million, and although it&#8217;s trending up, it has so much more potential.</p>
<p>We have been seeing more M&amp;A action in this space as companies try to fill in various parts of the sale-service-marketing triumvirate. Just last week, we saw Zendesk, the company that concentrates on cloud customer service, enter the sales automation and CRM part of the space with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/10/zendesk-expands-into-crm-with-base-acquisition/">the purchase of Base</a>. Earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/04/thoma-bravo-buys-majority-stake-in-apttus-in-unexpected-ending/">Thoma Bravo bought Apttus</a>, a company which covers the quote-to-cash part of the sales cycle.</p>
<p>Adobe finds itself competing with other giant organizations with the previously mentioned companies all lining up for a piece of the digital marketing business. Getting Marketo certainly has the potential to help push that Digital Experience revenue line up further as the fight for marketshare gets ever more intense. Whether that happens remains to be seen, but Marketo is certainly a company that would match up well with Adobe if it wanted to make such a move.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth mentioning that Adobe will be reporting <a href="https://www.adobe.com/investor-relations/earnings-call.html">its latest earnings</a> this afternoon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has quietly built and deployed an artificial intelligence programming tool called SapFix that scans code, automatically identifies bugs, tests different patches and suggests the best ones that engineers can choose to implement.<a href="https://code.fb.com/developer-tools/finding-and-fixing-software-bugs-automatically-with-sapfix-and-sapienz/"> Revealed today</a> at Facebook&#8217;s @Scale engineering conference, SapFix is already running on Facebook&#8217;s massive code base and the company plans to eventually share it with the developer community.</p>
<p>&#8220;To our knowledge, this marks the first time that a machine-generated fix — with automated end-to-end testing and repair — has been deployed into a codebase of Facebook’s scale,&#8221; writes Facebook&#8217;s developer tool team. &#8220;It’s an important milestone for AI hybrids and offers further evidence that search-based software engineering can reduce friction in software development.&#8221; SapFix can run with or without Sapienz, Facebook&#8217;s previous automated bug spotter. It uses it in conjunction with SapFix, suggesting solutions to problems Sapienz discovers.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-1712079 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Gray_SapFix4.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="335" /></p>
<p>These types of tools could allow smaller teams to build more powerful products, or let big corporations save a ton on wasted engineering time. That&#8217;s critical for Facebook as it has so many other problems to worry about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Glow AI hardware partners</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Facebook is pressing forward with its strategy of reorienting the computing hardware ecosystem around its own machine learning software. Today it <a href="https://code.fb.com/ml-applications/glow-a-community-driven-approach-to-ai-infrastructure/">announced</a> that its <a href="https://facebook.ai/developers/tools/glow">Glow compiler</a> for machine learning hardware acceleration has signed up the top silicon manufacturers, like Cadence, Esperanto, Intel, Marvell, and Qualcomm, to support Glow. The plan mirrors Facebook&#8217;s Open Compute Project for open sourcing server designs and Telecom Infra Project for connectivity technology.</p>
<p>Glow works with a wide array of machine learning frameworks and hardware accelerators to speed up how they perform deep learning processes. It was <a href="https://facebook.ai/developers/tools/glow">open sourced</a> earlier this year at Facebook&#8217;s F8 conference.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-1712106 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/slide20-copyHP.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Hardware accelerators are specialized to solve the task of machine learning execution. They typically contain a large number of execution units, on-chip memory banks, and application-specific circuits that make the execution of ML workloads very efficient,&#8221; Facebook&#8217;s team writes. &#8220;To execute machine learning programs on specialized hardware, compilers are used to orchestrate the different parts and make them work together . . . Hardware partners that use Glow can reduce the time it takes to bring their product to market.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_1712194" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1712194" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Jason-Taylor.jpg?w=543" alt="" width="320" height="401" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Facebook VP of infrastructure Jason Taylor</p></div>
<p>Essentially, Facebook needs help in the silicon department. Instead of isolating itself and building its own chips like <a href="https://qz.com/1073036/everything-you-need-to-know-about-apples-ai-chip/">Apple </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/25/google-is-making-a-fast-specialized-tpu-chip-for-edge-devices-and-a-suite-of-services-to-support-it/">Google</a>, it&#8217;s effectively outsourcing the hardware development to the experts. That means it might forego a competitive advantage from this infrastructure, but it also allows it to save money and focus on its core strengths.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I talked about today was the difficulty of predicting what chip will really do well in the market. When you build a piece of silicon, you&#8217;re making predictions about where the market is going to be in two years&#8221; Facebook&#8217;s VP of infrastructure Jason Taylor tells me. &#8220;The big question is if the workload that they design for is the worlflow that&#8217;s really important at the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>You&#8217;re going to see this fragmentation. At Facebook, wew want to work with all the partners out there so we have good options now and over the next several years.&#8221; Essentially, by partnering with all the chip makers instead of building its own, Facebook future-proofs its software against volatility in which chip becomes the standard.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1712113" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Facebook-Scale-Conference-2018.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="430" /></p>
<p>The technologies aside, the Scale conference was evidence that Facebook will keep hacking, policy scandals be damned. There was nary a mention of Cambridge Analytica or election interference as a packed room of engineers chuckled to nerdy jokes during keynotes packed with enough coding jargon to make the unindoctrinated assume it was in another language. If Facebook is burning, you couldn&#8217;t tell from here\</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><span class="il">Shift</span> Technologies, an online marketplace for used cars, has closed a Series D financing round of more than $140 million in equity and debt.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The round, which consists of about $70 million in debt and $71 million in equity, was led by automotive retailer Lithia Motors. Bryan DeBoer, CEO and president of Lithia, will join <span class="il">Shift</span>’s board of directors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Previous investors Alliance Ventures, BMW iVentures, DCM, DFJ, G2VP, Goldman Sachs Investment Partners and Highland Capital also participated. This new capital brings <span class="il">Shift</span>’s total financing of equity and debt to $265 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/shiftcars" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="shiftcars">Shift, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which is based in San Francisco, serves car buyers and sellers. The company, founded in 2013, has built a software platform that lets customers shop for cars, get financing and schedule test drives. Car owners can use the platform to sell their vehicle, as well. Shift says any car it buys must pass a &#8220;rigorous&#8221; 150+ point inspection.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company plans to invest in its technology platform and scale its engineering staff from 35 to more than 80 people by the end of 2019, CEO George Arison noted to TechCrunch in an email.  Shift employs 380 people. The company&#8217;s platform has focused on scaling in California; it covers about 80 percent of that market. But the company has long had its sights set on expanding beyond the Golden State.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Shift is focused on, and is heavily investing in, its peer-to-peer business, in which the company acquires cars from individuals and then sells them. Buying, refurbishing and then selling cars online is a logistics-heavy business pursuit, and one that has seen a number of competitors come and go in the past several years. But Arison says the company has not just survived; it has grown. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Shift didn&#8217;t provide revenue numbers. But Arison cited the company&#8217;s more than 70 percent revenue growth in the past six months as an example of the company&#8217;s success.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company did have a partnership with rental giant <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hertz" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hertz">Hertz, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> but that has since ended. At the time, Shift was going to feature vehicles from Hertz’s fleet inventory. It was meant to be a win-win: Hertz gets access to a new retail sales channel and Shift benefits from the rental car company’s ready supply of lightly used cars.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The partnership ended after Hertz opened its own retail stores that competed against Shift</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What once sounded like science fiction is now a reality: creating almost-perfectly faked videos of people saying things they never did.</p>
<p>Surprise: Now they&#8217;re a reality, thanks to modern computing power and the power to instantly share it on the world&#8217;s social stage.</p>
<p>But U.S. lawmakers are worried that these faked videos could be used by the enemy to harm national security.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re unaware, &#8220;deep fakes&#8221; are digitally manipulated videos — which, using existing footage mixed with artificial intelligence and machine learning, can be made to look like, or close to, the real thing.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, one of the first uses of deep fake videos was for porn — by superimposing faces onto others.</p>
<p>But now, lawmakers think that deep fakes could be used as part of wider disinformation campaigns — known to be a tactic of adversarial nation states like Russia — in an effort to sway elections or spread false news.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deep fakes could become a potent tool for hostile powers seeking to spread misinformation,&#8221; said Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4878217-Adam-Schiff-et-al-letter-to-DNI-over-deep-fakes.html">in a letter</a> to Dan Coats, director of national intelligence.</p>
<p>&#8220;As deep fake technology becomes more advanced and more accessible, it could pose a threat to United States public discourse and national security, with broad and concerning implications for offensive active measures campaigns targeting the United States,&#8221; said the letter, co-signed by Reps. Stephanie Murphy (D-FL) and Carlos Curbelo (R-FL).</p>
<p>The lawmakers have a point. In recent years, disinformation has risen and was a major factor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/04/facebooks-sandberg-sorry-for-election-meddling-but-us-intelligence-could-help-us-more/">in the meddling</a> during the 2016 presidential election. Now, instead of false and misleading news, it is fake videos of politicians throwing shade at their rivals — or worse.</p>
<p>Take this deep fake video — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ54GDm1eL0">created by BuzzFeed News</a> of what appears to be former President Obama calling President Trump a &#8220;dipshit&#8221; — to show how easy it is.</p>
<div id="attachment_1712063" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="breakout size-full wp-image-1712063" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/trump-obama-dipshit.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="613" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A deep fake video created by BuzzFeed News to show how easy it is to create false and misleading videos.</p></div>
<p>What might be good fun on one hand, on the other could have a major effect on those who are none the wiser.</p>
<p>Schiff, Murphy and Curbelo want the director of national intelligence — who oversees the nation&#8217;s intelligence community — to report back on its assessment of how deep fake technology could harm national security interests, and if there are countermeasures to protect against foreign influence — and their limitations.</p>
<p>The DNI&#8217;s office was asked to report back to Congress by mid-December.</p>
<p>ODNI spokesperson Charles Carithers told TechCrunch: “We have received the letter and will respond to Reps. Schiff, Murphy and Curbelo.”</p>

After making a show of keeping the headphone jack around for a few extra generations, OnePlus is finally succumbing to the inevitable.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You&#8217;ve got to make decisions that optimize the user experience, and understand that at times things that provide user value can also add friction,” co-founder Carl Pei<a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/the-oneplus-6t-wont-have-a-headphone-jack-but-battery-life-will-be-improved"> told TechRadar</a>. “We found 59 percent of our community already owned wireless headphones earlier this year &#8211; and that was before we launched our Bullets Wireless headphones.”</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">OnePlus made a bit of a show keeping the feature around, with Pei polling users on Twitter. The results were overwhelmingly pro-jack. That OnePlus maintained the input for a few more models makes sense — the company has long prided itself on the direct line of communication it maintains with its fan base.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And besides, forcing users to buy pricey Bluetooth headphones would have gone a ways toward counteracting the company’s focus on budget. Of course, there are plenty of cheap options these days, including the aforementioned $69 OnePlus bullets. The move leaves a smattering of headphone jacks remaining on flagship phones, including, most notably, Samsung. </span></p>

<p>In his first visit to the Canadian tech hub since becoming CEO of Uber last year, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/dara-khosrowshahi" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="dara-khosrowshahi">Dara Khosrowshahi <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced plans to invest $150 million in Toronto over the next five years. Uber will bring on 300 new employees, bringing the company&#8217;s total headcount in Toronto to 500. The new engineering hub is expected to open early next year.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Uber for comment.</p>
<p>“At Uber, we recognize Canada’s commitment to innovation and the vibrancy of Toronto’s tech ecosystem,” Khosrowshahi said in a statement provided to the<a href="https://www.thestar.com/business/technology/2018/09/13/uber-revs-up-its-toronto-operations-with-new-engineering-centre.html"> Toronto Star</a>. “We want to support the innovation coming out of this great, diverse region.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost exactly one year after announcing its Series A, website building platform <a href="https://www.strikingly.com/">Strikingly</a> said today that it has raised a $10 million Series A+. The new round was led by Cathay Capital, with participation from CAS Holding, the lead investor in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/striking-ly" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="striking-ly">Strikingly’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Series A. This brings Strikingly’s total funding so far to $17.5 million.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO David Chen tells TechCrunch that the funding is “technically a Series B level round for us,” but the team wanted to call it a Series A+ because the capital will be used to continue the momentum of products<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/five-years-after-its-launch-website-building-platform-strikingly-raises-6m-series-a/"> launched around the time of its Series A</a>, including a mobile website editor and a reseller program, as well as its growth in China. (Series A+ rounds are also more common in China, where Strikingly has an office in Shanghai and is one of the most popular website building services).</p>
<p>“The A+ is a natural continuation of what we’ve been doing since our Series A,” Chen says.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, Strikingly doubled the size of its team over the past year from 150 to 300 employees. The reseller program, launched in early 2017 after the company realized many Strikingly customers use the platform to build sites for other people, now has users in 70 countries. This year, Strikingly’s goal is to continue growing the program in Asia and introduce more features to help resellers with customer acquisition. The reseller program allows them to buy websites in bulk and gives them a dashboard to manage their clients’ sites. While Strikingly’s core product will continue being its website builder, Chen says its reseller program has helped boost its growth in many markets, particularly Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>When Strikingly launched back in 2012, it set itself apart from other website builders by focusing on easy to build, but polished-looking mobile responsive sites. Now mobile responsive sites are de rigueur for any website builder, but one of the things that continues to differentiate Strikingly from its competitors (a partial list includes Wix, Weebly, Squarespace and WordPress) is its ease of use. The company claims that the average time to launch a new website with Strikingly’s editor is just 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Strikingly also has another edge over competitors in China, where it’s already dealt with the hurdles faced by content management software providers. “Content is very strictly regulated and just being able to enter China was a big step forward from any of our counterparts in the U.S.,” says Chen. Over the past two years, he says Strikingly has become the leading website-building SaaS solution in China, thanks to partnerships with Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud and ZBJ, China’s largest market for freelancers. For example, Tencent Cloud users were offered free week-long trails of Strikingly and it is integrated into ZBJ’s platform.</p>
<p>“China is a huge market obviously and we have already done the hard work of being able to enter China,” says Chen. “We see a lot of opportunities here even beyond website building, but that being our core product gives us a very good entry point to any enterprise service marketplace in China.”</p>
