				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.chimebank.com/">Chime</a>, the no-fees mobile bank <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/31/no-fees-mobile-banking-service-chime-raises-70m-series-c-valuing-its-business-at-500m/">valued at $500 million as of its last round</a>, has put some of its funds to use with its first acquisition. The deal is for <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ferment-labs">Pinch</a>, a startup that was focused on helping millennials and other young adults build better credit. It was best known for a service called PinchRent, which allowed users to increase their credit scores over time by reporting on-time rent payments to credit bureaus.</p>
<p>Millennials can sometimes struggle to improve their credit, or are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/25/millennials-dont-understand-how-to-improve-credit-score.html">uneducated about what their credit scores mean</a>, studies have shown. And like any younger demographic, they may also be afflicted with shorter credit histories, which impacts those scores, too.</p>
<p>Many in this age group have said that <a href="https://moneyish.com/splurge/almost-half-of-millennials-say-that-their-credit-scores-are-holding-them-back/">their low credit scores</a> are holding them back, and millennials <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2018-04-26/millennials-spend-more-on-debit-purchases-than-credit">prefer debit to credit</a>, Visa has reported.</p>
<p>Pinch&#8217;s focus was to provide a different way for its users to increase their scores, rather than simply using credit cards or making loan payments on time.</p>
<p>It did this by aggregating the information on rent payments and submitting that to the credit bureaus. (The bureaus can take rental information, but they don&#8217;t work with individual landlords. That&#8217;s where Pinch came in.)</p>
<p>Since its founding in 2016, more than 80% of people on its service increased their scores from 10 to 100 points.</p>
<p>The startup was preparing to announce a $1.8 million seed round of funding from Homebrew and Collaborative ahead of its acquisition.</p>
<p>Pinch had only been in beta testing prior to joining <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/chime-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="chime-2">Chime, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and was also planning to do a full public launch. Instead, it shut down its service by <a href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/pinch-rent-shut-down-effective-immediately-credit-score-builder/">alerting users via email</a> that its last day of business would be June 27, 2018.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1712703" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-14-at-12.43.26-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="461" /></p>
<p>At the time of the service&#8217;s closure, it was in talks with Chime. But the deal itself only closed this Tuesday, we understand.</p>
<p>Chime declined to share the deal terms, but noted it&#8217;s an all-stock transaction and investors were happy.</p>
<p>The acquisition includes Pinch&#8217;s core team (5-10 people, depending on how the offers play out) plus founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maiabittner/">Maia Bittner</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/miradu/">Michael Ducker</a>, who will now help the mobile bank launch credit and lending products over the next six months.</p>
<p>Bittner previously co-founded subscription startup Rocksbox, and worked as a Sequoia Capital scout. Ducker, meanwhile, hailed from Microsoft and Twitter before starting Pinch.</p>
<p>Chime, whose user base is 90% millennials, may or may not relaunch Pinch&#8217;s rent-paying service, but it will be soon moving into credit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, particularly, post the 2008 crisis, there&#8217;s been just a general distrust of big banks. But also, people have seen how the amount of credit [they have] can create challenges in their life,&#8221; says Chime CEO Chris Britt, discussing the struggles its users face in terms of building their credit.</p>
<p>&#8220;And younger consumers are so saddled with with student loan debt that the last thing they want to do is get more debt on a credit card,&#8221; he adds, explaining why young people turn to debit cards.</p>
<p>He says Chime&#8217;s goal now is to helping serve this group&#8217;s needs around credit with a set of millennial-focused products.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reality is the typical debit card and checking account do nothing to build your credit score. So as we think about the future set of products that we want to roll out, we&#8217;re very focused on helping our members with that part of their life,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Chime is now one of several millennial-focused mobile banks on the market, which do away with traditional banking fees as well as brick-and-mortar location. Others like Simple and Stash are also available, but Chime <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/31/no-fees-mobile-banking-service-chime-raises-70m-series-c-valuing-its-business-at-500m/">has raised over $110 million</a>, making it the largest in terms of funding.</p>
<p>The company today also shared new numbers &#8211; it says it has over 1.7 million bank accounts on its platform, and is opening more than 150,000 accounts per month &#8211; in line with Wells Fargo. It expects to surpass 2 million bank accounts and $10 billion in total transaction volume by year-end.</p>
<p>Further down the road, Chime may venture into investing, but not until its user base is ready.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we&#8217;re very deliberate in how we think about helping our members along their financial journey. We start with the checking account, we make sure you&#8217;re paying all your bills, then we make sure you have a savings account balance &#8211; because you should have a savings account balance before you start day trading,&#8221; Britt says.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sort of irresponsible to be encouraging day trading if you don&#8217;t have the financial means&#8230;I think investment accounts and retirement accounts come first,&#8221; he notes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tomorrow is apparently Batman Day. That mostly means promotions from the folks at DC Entertainment and the <a href="https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2018/09/14/the-dc-universe-digital-subscription-service-is-finally-here">long-awaited launch</a> of the company’s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/dc-universe/"> DC Universe streaming service</a>. If nothing else, the site is an interesting mix of multimedia content in a world of video-only sites, including original series, older content and digital comics.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Users who signed up in advance will get early access to the site today, while everyone else is going to have to wait until tomorrow to sample the service for $8 a month or $75 for a full year. DC Universe will be available on a slew of platforms in the U.S., including iOS, Android, Apple TV, Android TV and Roku — or you can just watch it from a desktop or mobile browser à la Netflix.</span></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/d6rWiM1BQ5E?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If Netflix and Hulu have taught us anything, it’s that original content takes a while to get right, so remember that as you rewatch the trailer for the live action <em>Titans</em> series. That’s not slated to actually launch until October 12 — hopefully it will benefit from a little retooling after a preview that made even the hardest core of fanboys/girls audibly groan. At the very least, it means no Batman Day launch for a show in which Robin literally says “f*** Batman.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a number of other series on the docket, including some of the most beloved off-the-radar DC properties, like Young Justice: Outsiders, Doom Patrol, Swamp Thing, Harley Quinn and Stargirl. DC Universe will have stiff competition, however &#8212; along with the usual suspects, Marvel-owner Disney is set to launch a service of its own, likely next year. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As for Batman Day, there’s a lot of Dark Knight content, including the 80s/90s film series and two of the three Christopher Nolan films. Some of the caped crusader’s finest comics work is up there too, including The Dark Knight Returns, Batman Year One and Batman Year 100. </span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of f***ing Batman.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mary Meeker is leaving Kleiner Perkins to build a new fund and she&#8217;s taking the firm&#8217;s growth team with her.</span></p>
<p>The news, first reported by <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/9/14/17858582/kleiner-perkins-mary-meeker-split">Recode</a> and confirmed to TechCrunch, is the latest high-level departure at one of the most prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firms.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joining Meeker in her new fund are Kleiner Perkins GPs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood Rowghani and Noah Knauf, as well as Juliet de Baubigny, a partner. According to the firm, this is less of a messy break-up and more of an amicable and intentional decision to spin-off Kleiner&#8217;s growth-investing unit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The environment for venture has evolved — with larger checks being written for seed and A rounds and more support from partners required to build companies — demanding a high degree of specialization and extreme focus to excel,&#8221; a spokesperson for Kleiner Perkins said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. &#8220;The changes in both areas have led to less overlap between venture and growth and creating two separate firms with different people and operations now makes sense.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ve reached out to Meeker for comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A source close to the matter told me the decision was a no-brainer given the success of Kleiner&#8217;s growth fund under Meeker&#8217;s leadership and her desire to start her own firm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meeker, widely known for her<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/30/internet-trends-2018/"> annual Internet Trends Report</a> (don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s not going anywhere), joined the firm in 2010 after two decades as a managing director at Morgan Stanley. She was well-established as a tech analyst on Wall Street. In Silicon Valley, she quickly built a reputation as one of the best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was one of few women to earn a GP title at Kleiner Perkins in an industry where women have traditionally been shut out from the highest roles in VC. There will be no female GPs at Kleiner in her wake.</span></p>
<h2>A new era at Kleiner Perkins</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 1972, Kleiner has been around to support some of the biggest names in tech. It&#8217;s backed Google, Aol and Amazon, and more recently, Slack, Uber and Peloton. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meeker, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rowghani and Knauf&#8217;s departures, as well as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several other recent exits, signal a new era at the firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">legendary investor John Doerr stepped down as managing partner in 2016, replaced by Ted Schlein, the firm has been hemorrhaging top talent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schlein, however, seems unphased. In an interview with Recode, he said he didn&#8217;t think it was a &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">huge deal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The late-stage team at Kleiner “continued to diverge away from what the core part of Kleiner Perkins has done for 46 years, and will continue to do for another 46 years,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just last week, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">longtime Kleiner investor, and the only other female GP, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/long-time-kleiner-perkins-investor-beth-seidenberg-has-raised-320m-for-her-own-fund/">Beth Seidenberg took the wraps off her own fund</a> after<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/15/beth-seidenberg-of-kleiner-perkins-is-said-to-be-leaving-to-start-her-own-fund/"> announcing in May</a> she would be leaving the firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, general partner Mike Abbott left the firm one month after Arielle Zuckerberg, a partner, also exited.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/31/several-departures-at-venture-firm-kleiner-perkins/"> The pair was part of a group of seven to leave Kleiner at the time.</a></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been over a year since highly classified exploits built by the National Security Agency were stolen and published online.</p>
<p>One of the tools, dubbed EternalBlue, can covertly break into almost any Windows machine around the world. It didn&#8217;t take long for hackers to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/12/ransomware-based-on-leaked-nsa-tools-spreads-to-dozens-of-countries/">start using the exploits</a> to run ransomware on thousands of computers, grinding hospitals and businesses to a halt. Two separate attacks in as many months used WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware, which spread like wildfire. Once a single computer in a network was infected, the malware would also target other devices on the network. The recovery was slow and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/16/maersk-says-notpetya-cyberattack-could-cost-300-million.html">cost companies hundreds of millions</a> in damages.</p>
<p>Yet, more than a year since <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-reverses-course-patches-three-remaining-nsa-exploits-targeting-windows-xp/">released patches</a> that slammed the backdoor shut, <a href="https://www.shodan.io/search?query=port%3A445+%22SMB+Version%3A+1%22+os%3AWindows+%21product%3ASamba">almost a million computers and networks</a> are still unpatched and vulnerable to attack.</p>
<p>Although WannaCry infections have slowed, hackers are still using the publicly accessible NSA exploits to infect computers to mine cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Nobody knows that better than one major Fortune 500 multinational, which was hit by a massive WannaMine cryptocurrency mining infection just days ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our customer is a very large corporation with multiple offices around the world,&#8221; said Amit Serper, who heads the security research team at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/06/cybereason-raises-25m-because-corporate-security-is-broken/">Boston-based Cybereason</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once their first machine was hit the malware propagated to more than 1,000 machines in a day,&#8221; he said, without naming the company.</p>
<p>Cryptomining attacks have been around for a while. It&#8217;s more common for hackers to inject cryptocurrency mining code into vulnerable websites, but the payoffs are low. Some news sites are now <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/02/salon-is-offering-readers-to-suppress-ads-in-exchange-for-cryptocurrency-mining-power.html">installing their own mining code</a> as an alternative to running ads.</p>
<p>But WannaMine works differently, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cybereason" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cybereason">Cybereason <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said in its <a href="https://www.cybereason.com/blog/wannamine-cryptominer-eternalblue-wannacry">post-mortem</a> of the infection. By using those leaked NSA exploits to gain a single foothold into a network, the malware tries to infect any computer within. It&#8217;s persistent so the malware can survive a reboot. After it&#8217;s implanted, the malware uses the computer&#8217;s processor to mine cryptocurrency. On dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of computers, the malware can mine cryptocurrency far faster and more efficiently. Though it&#8217;s a drain on energy and computer resources, it can often go unnoticed.</p>
<p>After the malware spreads within the network, it modifies the power management settings to prevent the infected computer from going to sleep. Not only that, the malware tries to detect other cryptomining scripts running on the computer and terminates them — likely to squeeze every bit of energy out of the processor, maximizing its mining effort.</p>
<div id="attachment_1712595" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="breakout size-full wp-image-1712595" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-14-at-11.15.53-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="574" /><p class="wp-caption-text">At least 300,000 computers or networks are still vulnerable to the NSA&#8217;s EternalBlue hacking tools.</p></div>
<p>Based <a href="https://www.shodan.io/search?query=port%3A445+%22SMB+Version%3A+1%22+os%3AWindows+%21product%3ASamba">on up-to-date statistics</a> from Shodan, a search engine for open ports and databases, at least 919,000 servers are still vulnerable to EternalBlue, with some 300,000 machines in the US alone. And that&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg — that figure can represent either individual vulnerable computers or a vulnerable network server capable of infecting hundreds or thousands more machines.</p>
<p>Cybereason said companies are still severely impacted because their systems aren&#8217;t protected.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no reason why these exploits should remain unpatched,&#8221; the blog post said. &#8220;Organizations need to install security patches and update machines.&#8221;</p>
<p>If not ransomware yesterday, it&#8217;s cryptomining malware today. Given how versatile the EternalBlue exploit is, tomorrow it could be something far worse — like data theft or destruction.</p>
<p>In other words: if you haven&#8217;t patched already, what are you waiting for?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.elvie.com/">Elvie</a>, a Berlin-based startup known best for its connected Kegel trainer, is jumping into the breast pump business with a new $480 hands-free system you can slip into your bra.</p>
<p>Even with all the innovation in baby gear, breast pumps have mostly sucked (pun intended) for new moms for the past half a century. My first experience with a pump required me to stay near a wall socket and hunch over for a good 20 to 30 minutes for fear the milk collected might spill all over the place (which it did anyway, frequently). It was awful!</p>
<p>Next I tried the Willow Pump, an egg-shaped, connected pump meant to liberate women everywhere with its small and mobile design. It received <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=willow+pump&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj50YXO8rjdAhUIJXwKHUKnDmcQ_AUIDCgD&amp;biw=1401&amp;bih=724">glowing reviews</a>, though my experience with it was less than stellar.</p>
<p>The proprietary bags were hard to fit in the device, filled up with air, cost 50 cents each (on top of the $500 pump that insurance did not cover), wasted many a golden drop of precious milk in the transfer and I had to reconfigure placement several times before it would start working. So I&#8217;ve been tentatively excited about the announcement of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/chiaro-technology-ltd" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="chiaro-technology-ltd">Elvie&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> new cordless (and silent??) double breast pump.</p>
<div id="attachment_1711473" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="breakout size-full wp-image-1711473" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/4-Elvie-Pump-single-with-app-screen.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Displayed: a single Elvie pump with accompanying app</p></div>
<p>Elvie tells TechCrunch its aim all along has been to make health tech for women and that it has been working on this pump for the past three years.</p>
<p>The Elvie Pump is a cordless, hands-free, closed-system, rechargeable electric pump designed by former Dyson engineers. It can hold up to 5 oz. from each breast in a single use.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s most obvious and direct competition is the Willow pump, another &#8220;wearable&#8221; pump moms can put right in their bra and walk around in, hands-free. However, unlike the Willow, Elvie&#8217;s pump does not need proprietary bags. You just pump right into the device and the pump&#8217;s smartphone app will tell you when each side is full.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also half the size and weight of a Willow and saves every precious drop it can by pumping right into the attached bottle so you just pump and feed (no more donut-shaped bags you have to cut open and awkwardly pour into a bottle).</p>
<p>On top of that, Elvie claims this pump is silent. No more loud suction noise off and on while trying to pump in a quiet room in the office or elsewhere. It&#8217;s small, easy to carry around and you can wear it under your clothes without it making a peep! While the Willow pump claims to be quiet &#8212; and it is, compared to other systems &#8212; you can still very much hear it while you are pumping.</p>
<div id="attachment_1711478" style="width: 3010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="breakout wp-image-1711478 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/5-Elvie-Pump-single-app-screens.jpg" alt="" width="3000" height="1863" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Elvie&#8217;s connected breast pump app</p></div>
<p>All of these features sound fantastic to this new (and currently pumping) mom. I remember in the early days of my baby&#8217;s life wanting to go places but feeling stuck. I was chained to not just all the baby gear, hormonal shifts and worries about my newborn but to the pump and feed schedule itself, which made it next to impossible to leave the house for the first few months.</p>
<p>My baby was one of those &#8220;<a href="http://www.the-essential-infant-resource-for-moms.com/Newborn-Nursing.html">gourmet eaters</a>&#8221; who just nursed and nursed all day. There were days I couldn&#8217;t leave the bed! Having a silent, no mess, hands-free device that fit right in my bra would have made a world of difference.</p>
<p>However, I mentioned the word &#8220;tentatively&#8221; above, as I have not had a chance to do a hands-on review of Elvie&#8217;s pump. The Willow pump also seemed to hold a lot of promise early on, yet left me disappointed.</p>
<p>To be fair, the company&#8217;s customer service team was top-notch and did try to address my concerns. I even went through two &#8220;coaching&#8221; sessions, but in the end it seemed the blame was put on me for not getting their device to work correctly. That&#8217;s a bad user experience if you are blaming others for your design flaws, especially new and struggling moms.</p>
<p><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712339" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/13-Elvie-Pump-single_double-in-top.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p>Both companies are founded by women and make products for women &#8212; and it&#8217;s about time. But it seems as if Elvie has taken note of the good and bad in their competitors and had time to improve upon it &#8212; and that&#8217;s what has me excited.</p>
<p>As my fellow TechCrunch writer Natasha put it in her <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/12/elvie-early-impressions/">initial review</a> of Elvie as a company, &#8220;It’s not hyperbole to say Elvie is a new breed of connected device. It’s indicative of the lack of smart technology specifically — and intelligently — addressing women.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">So why the pump? &#8220;We recognized the opportunity [in the market] was smarter tech for women,&#8221; founder and CEO Tania Boler told TechCrunch on her company&#8217;s move into the breast pump space. &#8220;Our aim is to transform the way women think and feel about themselves by providing the tools to address the issues that matter most to them, and Elvie Pump does just that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The Elvie Pump comes in three sizes and shapes to fit the majority of breasts and, in case you want to check your latch or pump volume, also has transparent nipple shields with markings to help guide the nipple to the right spot.</p>
<p>The app connects to each device via Bluetooth and tracks your production, detects let down, will pause when full and is equipped to pump in seven different modes.</p>
<p>The pump retails for $480 and is currently available in the U.K. However, those in the U.S. will have to wait until closer to the end of the year to get their hands on one. According to the company, it will be available on Elvie.com and Amazon.com, as well in select physical retail stores nationally later this year, pending FDA approval.</p>

The latest ex-Tesla employee to join Lyft is Cal Lankton, who most recently led the development of Tesla&#8217;s electric vehicle charging network <a href="https://electrek.co/2018/05/31/tesla-head-of-energy-operations-amazon-europe-bmw/">up until May</a>. At Lyft, Lankton will serve as VP of infrastructure operations where he will focus on the next generation of Lyft&#8217;s driver hubs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came to Lyft because I believe in the company’s priorities of driver care and environmental sustainability, and I know that our retail footprint can effectively marry the two through smart design and deployment,&#8221; Lankton said in a statement.</p>
<p>Lyft is also bringing on board Geoffrey Bain from Unilever to serve as the company&#8217;s senior director of retail operations. Both will work with Lyft VP of Driver Experience Operations Karim Bousta, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/25/lyft-brings-on-ex-tesla-vp-to-lead-driver-experience-operations/">who joined the company in July from Tesla</a>.  All of the aforementioned people report to Lyft COO Jon McNeill, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/07/lyft-hires-teslas-president-of-sales-service-as-coo/">who joined Lyft &#8212; also from Tesla &#8212; in February</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Cal and Geoffrey leading our retail strategy, I am confident that our next-generation service centers will exceed driver expectations, and they will see the results of this team’s dedication reflected in their earnings,&#8221; McNeill said in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In May, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/23/lyft-invests-100-million-in-its-drivers/">Lyft committed</a> $100 million to better support its drivers by specifically putting the money toward cheaper oil changes, basic car maintenance, serviced car washes and more. Lyft also will almost double its operating hours at its driver hubs in 15 cities throughout the nation.</p>
<p>The idea with that commitment is to help drivers make more money and maximize their earnings by offsetting the costs of driving. Other benefits will include car and SUV rentals, tax education and more.</p>
<p>Lyft also says it expects to more than double its driver base in the next five years. Currently, Lyft has 1.4 million drivers, <a href="https://take.lyft.com/economic-impact/">according to its latest economic impact report</a>.</p>

<p>The world&#8217;s top tech companies have heavily invested in AR/VR and are persistent in broadcasting the technologies&#8217; potential to blur the lines of how consumers interact with the digital world. Beyond the tech titans, it&#8217;s the small startups that are dialing into what&#8217;s missing in the ecosystem right now. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-ar-vr-2018/?utm_medium=post07&amp;utm_campaign=arvr_2018&amp;utm_source=TC&amp;unii-trigger-open=2LGN89&amp;ref=post07" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our agenda</a> showcases some of the powerhouses in the space, but also plenty of smaller teams that are building and debunking fundamental technologies for virtual worlds.</p>
<p>We still have a few tricks up our sleeves and will be adding some new names to the agenda over the next month so keep your eyes open. In the meantime, check out these agenda highlights:</p>

<h2>TechCrunch Sessions: AR/VR<br />
<strong style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">UCLA, Los Angeles // October 18<br />
See full agenda <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-ar-vr-2018/?utm_medium=post07&amp;utm_campaign=arvr_2018&amp;utm_source=TC&amp;unii-trigger-open=2LGN89&amp;ref=post07" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kickstarting an Industry<br />
</strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/yelena-rachitsky">Yelena Rachitsky</a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/oculus-vr">Oculus</a>] </strong><strong><br />
</strong><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oculus-vr" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oculus-vr">Oculus <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into funding VR content, and while the headset market is still small, developers have built plenty of games and experiences. Facebook&#8217;s VR future rests on people finding new worlds that they want to step into, how will Oculus make this happen?<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></li>
<li><strong>The Social Experiment<br />
</strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/adam-arrigo">Adam Arrigo</a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/thewave">TheWaveVR</a>]</strong>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/sophia-dominguez-2">Sophia Dominguez</a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/svrf">SVRF</a>] </strong>and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/gil-baron-2">Gil Baron</a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/visionary-vr">Mindshow</a>]</strong><strong><br />
</strong>If anything, the OculusVR acquisition in 2014 signaled that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> saw VR as a social final frontier. No one really knows what exactly those interactions looks like though, but there&#8217;s an awful lot that&#8217;s already been explored.<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></li>
<li><strong>Reality Checks<br />
</strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/niko-bonatsos">Niko Bonatsos</a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/general-catalyst-partners">General Catalyst</a>]</strong>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/catherine-ulrich">Catherine Ulrich</a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/firstmark-capital">FirstMark Capital</a>] </strong>and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jacob-mullins">Jacob Mullins</a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/shasta-ventures">Shasta Ventures</a>]</strong><strong><br />
</strong><em>“[VR] is the frothiest space in the Valley right now. Nobody understands it but everyone wants in. Any idiot could walk into a f***ing room, utter the letters ‘V’ and ‘R’, and VCs would hurl bricks of cash at them.&#8221; </em><em>&#8211; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsXK0w4CUtg">Erlich Bachmann</a>. </em>While this may have indeed been the case a couple years ago, investor cash has been a bit sparser in 2018. Where are the opportunities now?<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></li>
<li><strong>Staying Lean and Mean<br />
</strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/maureen-fan">Maureen Fan</a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/baobab-studios">Baobab Studios</a>] </strong><strong><br />
</strong>Baobab Studios has raised $31 million from top investors to create cinematic VR that excites audiences. While VR startups raised plenty of cash in 2016 and 2017, slow headset sales have caused startups to focus on building for a virtual future that might take a couple more years to reach.<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></li>
<li><strong>Cloud 6<br />
</strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/matt-miesnieks">Matt Miesnieks</a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/6d-ai">6D.ai</a>] </strong>and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/bertrand-wooden">Bruce Wooden</a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/6d-ai">6D.ai</a>] </strong><strong><br />
</strong>AR is out there, but the experiences available today are still feeling pretty isolated. 6D.ai is building out cloud AR tech to link these experiences together on a digital layer of the real world.<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></li>
<li><strong>Ditching Headsets for Holograms<br />
</strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/shawn-frayne">Shawn Frayne</a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/looking-glass">Looking Glass Factory</a>]</strong>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/brett-jones-4">Brett Jones</a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lightform">Lightform</a>] </strong>and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/ashley-crowder">Ashley Crowder</a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vntana-2">VNTANA</a>]</strong><strong><br />
</strong>Augmented reality may be a powerful sight, but it requires participants to own expensive hardware. Is there a workaround? Startups are working to centralize the experience but it&#8217;s going to look a lot different.<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></li>
<li><strong>Game Theory<br />
</strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/nathan-burba">Nathan Burba</a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/survios">Survios</a>] </strong>and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/james-iliff">James Iliff</a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/survios">Survios</a>] </strong><strong><br />
</strong>While VR might not just be about gaming, it&#8217;s accurate to say that, in 2018, it mainly is. Survios has raised nearly $55M to show the potential of VR gaming, as the studio continue releasing new titles, can they keep their momentum going and will gaming continue to be the big opportunity?<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></li>
<li><strong>Early Days, Early Bets<br />
</strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/peter-rojas">Peter Rojas</a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/betaworks-ventures">Betaworks</a>]</strong><em> other speakers to be announced soon</em><strong><br />
</strong>Fewer AR/VR startups seem to be raising big seed rounds in 2018, but how have early-stage investors changed their approach to funding new talent in the space? How should founders get their attention?<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></li>
<li><strong>Building Inclusive Worlds<br />
</strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/cyan-banister">Cyan Banister</a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/founders-fund">Founders Fund</a>] </strong><em>other speakers to be announced soon </em><br />
If you had the chance to redesign society, where would you even start? As game developers continue designing massive online virtual worlds where we will spend more and more time, how should we look to correct issues we encounter and how can we build a better future?<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></li>
<li><strong>Augmenting the Office<br />
</strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/clorama-dorvilias">Clorama Dorvilias</a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/debias-vr">DebiasVR</a>]</strong> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/derek-belch">Derek Belch</a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/strivr-labs-inc">STRIVR</a>] </strong>and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/morgan-mercer">Morgan Mercer</a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vantage-point-99a0">Vantage Point</a>]</strong><em> </em><strong><br />
</strong>How can businesses learn from mistakes before making them? By training employees with VR, there&#8217;s the potential to more accurately simulate key scenarios and push people towards good choices.<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></li>
<li><strong>Your Virtual Self<br />
</strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/dr-parham-aarabi">Parham Aarabi </a> <strong>[<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/modiface">ModiFace</a>] </strong><em>other speakers to be announced soon<br />
</em>Smartphone AR is already in your pocket, but what can consumers actually use it for? While Snapchat face filters took us half-way there, new tech is making it easier for us to augment our faces with real world use cases while also getting closer to building out realistic avatars of our virtual selves.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Things have been pretty quiet on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/22/new-study-predicts-atlanta-has-best-shot-at-becoming-amazons-hq2/">Amazon HQ2</a> front. Earlier this year, the online retail giant announced that it had whittled the list of potential host cities for a second headquarters down to 20, but beyond that, the company hasn’t shared much. Looks like we’ll be getting an answer before end of year, however. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During a speech at the Economic Club of Washington this week,<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-ceo/amazons-bezos-says-trump-should-be-glad-of-media-scrutiny-idUSKCN1LU040"> CEO Jeff Bezos said</a> a decision will be made in 2018, though didn’t provide any insight into which way the company was leaning. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cities around North America have been following all over themselves to win the bid, which Amazon says will bring 50,000 jobs and $5 billion in investment. The move comes as Seattle, the home of HQ1 has put the company under increased scrutiny. In July, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> helped <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/13/jeff-bezos-launches-2-billion-fund-to-finance-preschools-and-help-homeless-families/">kill a business tax</a> designed to help fund low-income housing and homeless shelters. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Local tax breaks will no doubt be a deciding factor in where the company ultimately decides to set up shop.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bezos in particular has also been the target of criticism on a national level. Last week, Senator Bernie Sanders <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/bernie-sanders-intros-stop-bad-employers-by-zeroing-out-subsidies-bezos-bill/">introduced</a> the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (BEZOS) bill, designed to curb “corporate welfare.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is the wealthiest person on Earth, and since the beginning of this year, his wealth has increased by about $260 million every day,” Sanders’ office in a release around the bill. “Meanwhile, thousands of Amazon workers rely on food stamps because their wages are so low.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Trump has also been critical of Bezos, albeit for very different reasons, as the Amazon founder also owns The Washington Post, a paper that’s released a number of high-profile bombshells about his administration. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bezos took on Trump during the Economic Club of Washington address, stating, “it is really dangerous to demonize the media. It is dangerous to call the media lowlifes, it is dangerous to say that they are the enemy of the people.”</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.3dhubs.com">3D Hubs</a>, like <a href="https://www.makexyz.com">MakeXYZ</a>, was a community-based 3D printing service that let anyone with a printer sell their prints online. Founded in the heyday of the 3D printing revolution, the service let thousands of makers gather a little cash for making and mailing prints on their home 3D printers.</p>
<p>Now, however, the company has moved to a model in which its high-end partners will be manufacturing plastic, metal, and injection molded parts for customers willing to pay extra for a professional print.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, more focus on high end printers run by professional companies,&#8221; said founder Brian Garret. &#8220;So a smaller pool of manufacturing locations (still hundreds around the world), but with more control on standardized quality and repeatability. Our software takes care of the sourcing, so companies order with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/3d-hubs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="3d-hubs">3D Hubs <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> directly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not everyone is happy with the decision. <a href="https://twitter.com/pilz?lang=en">3DPrint.come editor Joris Peels</a> saw the value in a solid, dedicated community of hobbyists in the 3D space. The decision to move away from hobbyist printers, wrote Peels, &#8220;has confused many.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The value of 3DHubs is in its community; the community gives it granular local presence and a barrier to entry. Now it is just like any 3D printing service upstart and will lose its community entirely. I’ve always liked 3DHubs, although I have been very skeptical of their Trends Report I like the company and what they’re doing. I liked the idealism coupled with business,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>The community, for its part, is angry.</p>

<p>The move will happen on <a href="https://www.3dhubs.com/blog/3d-hubs-announces-suite-of-new-features-and-switch-to-fulfilled-by-3d-hubs-2/">October 1</a> when all prints will be completed by Fulfilled by 3D Hubs partners, dedicated merchants who will offer &#8220;source parts for larger, high value engineering projects.&#8221; The company wrote that during the early hobbyist days the &#8220;platform at that time was very much free-form, with the goal of serving as many, mostly one-off, custom maker projects as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>This slow movement from hobbyist 3D printing to professional parts manufacturer is not surprising or unexpected, but it is jarring. The 3D printing community is small, vociferous, and dedicated to the technology. In the early days, when 3D printers were rare, it was tempting to buy a mid-price printer and become a small, one-person shop online. Now, with the availability of commodity printers that cost less than some paper printers, the novelty and utility of a low-resolution print has fallen considerably.</p>
<p>3D printing never fulfilled its promise in the home and small office. A one-off print can save some of us a trip to the machine shop or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/9fs7e0/printed_an_ukulele/">music store</a> but in practice home 3D printing has been a bust.</p>
<p>Like most open source technologies that went commercial, the dedicated zealots will complain and the established players will pivot into profitability. It ruffles feathers, to be sure, but that&#8217;s how these things work. To paraphrase the White Stripes, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re in your little room and you&#8217;re printing something good/ But if it&#8217;s really good, you&#8217;re gonna need a bigger room/ And when you&#8217;re in the bigger room, you might not know what to do/ You might have to think of how you got started sitting in your little room.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cbs.com/all-access">CBS All Access</a>, the network&#8217;s over-the-top streaming service for cord cutters, will now let subscribers save shows for offline viewing. The feature, &#8220;Download &amp; Play,&#8221; is only available to those on CBS&#8217;s Commercial Free plan, not those on the cheaper, ad-supported tier. It also supports a range of programming, including CBS All Access Originals, reality shows, primetime dramas, news magazines, and other classics from the CBS library.</p>
<p>At launch, the lineup of supported shows includes originals like <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em>, <em>The Good Fight</em>, <em>One Dollar, Strange Angel, </em>and<em> No Activity, </em>plus <em>Big Brother, Survivor,</em> <em>Blue Bloods, Bull, Hawaii Five-0, MacGyver, NCIS: New Orleans, 60 Minutes, </em>and<em> 48 Hours. </em>All classics will also be available for offline access, meaning you can download old <em>Star Trek</em> episodes, <em>Cheers</em>, <em>Twin Peaks</em> and many others.</p>
<p>Content from local stations, local news and sports will not be available for offline viewing.</p>
<p>There are a few caveats in using the download feature. The content is only available offline for 30 days after the download, or 48 hours from the time of playback. If it expires, you&#8217;ll then have to download it again.</p>
<p>Downloads are also only available in the U.S. for the time being, CBS says.</p>
<p>However, users are able to download up to 25 videos at once, and can watch videos on up to 5 different devices.</p>
<p>The feature is going live on both iOS and Android, on version 6.0 of the CBS All Access app and higher.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-1626764 alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cbs-all-access.png?w=435" alt="" width="435" height="323" /></p>
<p>The company considers this a &#8220;premium&#8221; option, which is why it&#8217;s only making it available to Commercial Free subscribers, it says.</p>
<p>In reality, though, CBS may need more time to make ad attribution work on offline content &#8211; something that&#8217;s still fairly new.</p>
<p>Hulu, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/02/hulu-passes-20-million-subscribers-will-finally-offer-offline-viewing/">only recently announced it would allow offline viewing</a>, including the download of commercials for those on its ad-supported plan. It then became the first in the industry to support downloads with ads, it said during its Upfront presentation in May.</p>
<p>CBS may choose to invest in similar technology in the future, but for now, it&#8217;s easier to just roll out offline support to those who pay more to skip the commercials.</p>
<p>Other major streamers have allowed for downloads for years, it&#8217;s worth noting. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/30/netflix-adds-offline-viewing-for-smartphones-and-tablets/">Netflix added support on mobile</a> back in 2016, following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/01/amazon-prime-instant-video-now-lets-ios-and-android-owners-download-titles-for-offline-viewing/">Amazon Prime Video&#8217;s launch of offline support</a> the year prior.</p>
<p>The addition of offline support for CBS All Access means you&#8217;ll be able to watch shows when you&#8217;re out of reach of a network or good signal &#8211; like when traveling, commuting, or on a plane, for example. (Maybe I&#8217;ll finally finish this new, not so great <em>Star Trek</em>). Or you can use the option to save money on your data plan.</p>
<p>But the feature will matter even more as CBS <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/07/cbs-all-access-is-doubling-down-on-originals-planning-expansion-to-canada-and-australia/">expands its originals catalog</a>, which will include new shows like a reboot of <em>The Twilight Zone</em> from <em>Get Out</em> director, Jordan Peele; <em>Scream</em> writer and producer Kevin Williamson’s twisted fairytale series <em><a href="http://deadline.com/2017/11/tell-me-a-story-cbs-all-access-dark-fairytale-thriller-series-kevin-williamson-kapital-entertainment-1202217555/">Tell Me a Story</a>;</em> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/04/patrick-stewart-is-returning-to-the-role-of-jean-luc-picard-for-a-new-star-trek-series/">a new <em>Star Trek</em> series led by Patrick Stewart,</a> among others.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drivers of new Mercedes-Benz A-Class vehicles will soon be able to talk to their cars. And the cars will respond. Ask the car to turn on the heads-up display or for sports scores. Say you&#8217;re hungry and it will suggest restaurants. The new in-vehicle assistant utilizes local and cloud data to provide drivers plenty to talk about.</p>
<p>The service was built by a 13-year old startup run out of Santa Clara, CA called <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/soundhound" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="soundhound">SoundHound <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. Originally, the company launched as a Shazam-like service but kept evolving into a robust conversational artificial intelligence service. Different versions of SoundHound&#8217;s service are available <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/01/hound-a-voice-powered-virtual-assistant-app-launches-publicly/">on a number of platforms</a> including iOS, Android and in several vehicles made by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/27/kia-and-hyundai-cars-will-include-ai-assistants-starting-in-2019/">Kia and Hyundai</a>.</p>
<p>Mercedes&#8217; version of SoundHound&#8217;s service is two parts. Some of the requests, mostly about the vehicle&#8217;s systems, are processed locally. If a driver asks about sports scores or stock prices or a gas station location, the service reaches out to a cloud service to retrieve the latest information. The service is location-aware, too, allowing the driver to ask about nearby restaurants without specifying a city to search within.</p>
<p>The voice assistant is part of Mercedes-Benz&#8217;s new MBUX user interface. The car company says it&#8217;s highly personalized and configurable and adapts to the user over time.</p>
<p>In May of 2018 Mercedes-Benz joined four other investors including Tencent and Hyundai Motors in a $100m million corporate round. The company has raised $215 million to date through six rounds of funding since 2005.</p>
<p>This voice service comes a week after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/bmw-launches-a-personal-voice-assistant-for-its-cars/">BMW announced its custom-built in-vehicle voice assistant</a>. As voice assistant gain household penetration, more automakers are looking to cash in on consumer&#8217;s acceptance of technology. The trick is finding a balance between utility and novelty. Car companies cannot simply turn to Amazon and build-in Alexa; Alexa is not meant for in-car users. Rather, car companies must use off-the-shelf systems like from SoundHound or Clinc or build their own service to best suit their users.</p>

<p>The DelFly is a super light, super agile robot that flies like a real insect. By using a quad-wing flapping system, this odd little bot can flit, hover, and land like a fruit fly.</p>
<p>Part of a <a href="http://www.delfly.nl">research project at the Delft University of Technology</a>, this is the latest version of the DelFly and it can now perform high speed maneuvers including rapid turns.</p>
<p>From the release:</p>
<blockquote><p>The so far unmatched combination of performances makes the lightweight (and thus inherently safe) natural-looking robot ready for many real-world tasks. At the same time, the high agility, combined with the programmability of the robot, opens up a new way of studying insect flight dynamics and control during high agility maneuvers, such as rapid banked turns observed in fruit-flies when evading predators.</p></blockquote>
<p>The robot flies by rolling in the air and it has four wings to control three axes of flight. It flies left and right by changing the way each wing flaps.</p>
<p>The researchers, Matěj Karásek, Florian T. Muijres, Christophe De Wagter, Bart D.W. Remes, and Guido C.H.E. de Croon, wrote about the DelFly in an article for Science called &#8220;A tailless aerial robotic flapper reveals that flies use torque coupling in rapid banked turns.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/netflix" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="netflix">Netflix <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> on Thursday announced a new program aimed at <a href="https://pta.netflixstudios.com/faq">helping</a> Netflix Originals artists and producers select the right tools for delivering their content to its streaming service. With the launch of the<a href="https://pta.netflixstudios.com/"> Netflix Post Technology Alliance</a>, as the program is called, Netflix will now identify products from vendors that meet technical and delivery specifications today, and will continue to support any specifications that Netflix rolls out in the future.</p>
<p>The program&#8217;s focus is on certifying vendors&#8217; products across categories, including cameras, creative editorial, color grading, and IMF packaging.</p>
<p>Some <a href="https://pta.netflixstudios.com/participating-products">vendors </a>whose products have already received certification include  Adobe, Arri, Avid, Blackmagic Design, Canon, Colorfront, Fraunhofer IIS, Filmlight, Marquise Technologies, MTI Film, Ownzones, Panasonic, Red Digital Cinema, Rohde &amp; Schwarz, and Sony.</p>
<p>These products will be allowed to sport the Netflix Post Technology Alliance logo, to alert artists of their certification status.</p>
<p>&#8220;Manufacturers of products bearing this logo are closely partnered with Netflix,&#8221; the company explained via  a post on its tech blog. &#8220;They have early access to the Netflix technical roadmap and collaborate with Netflix on technical support, training, and updates. As Netflix technical requirements evolve, you can be assured products bearing this logo will evolve in step with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The program doesn&#8217;t extend to every type of tool used in production, however. For example, it won&#8217;t include lenses.</p>
<p>But many other of the other tools that are used will join the program in time, as new products submit themselves for inclusion.</p>
<p>Netflix explains its goal here is not to dictate to artists what tools have to be used &#8211; they should use whatever best makes sense for their efforts, it says. Instead, it&#8217;s about being able to quickly identify those tools that have been vetted for delivery to Netflix, as well as being able to identify companies who plan to continue to work with the streamer&#8217;s evolving tech on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Flagging products like this could help smaller producers just getting started, and that, in turn, could help feed more content into the streaming service over time, as their works won&#8217;t get rejected for quality issues.</p>
<p>The program joins others Netflix already runs, including a <a href="https://np3.netflixstudios.com/">Post Partner Program</a>, which collaborates with post-production partners worldwide, and the <a href="https://npfp.netflixstudios.com/">Preferred Fulfillment Partner program</a>, which represents a global network of media fulfillment companies.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe src="https://embed.simplecast.com/2bc06c0b?color=f5f5f5" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780?mt=2">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>After a long run of having guests climb aboard each week, we took a pause on that front, bringing together three of our regular hosts instead: <a href="http://twitter.com/cookie">Connie Loizos</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Danny Chrichton</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">and myself</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that there were just three of us instead of the usual four, we got through a mountain of stuff. Which was good as it was a surprisingly busy week, and we didn&#8217;t want to leave too much behind.</p>
<p>Up top we dug into the latest in the land of crypto, which Danny had politely summarized for us <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/13/the-second-blockchain-bubble-is-now-complete-whats-next/">in an article</a>. The gist of his argument is that the analogies relating crypto as an industry to the Internet may work, but most people have their timelines wrong: Crypto isn&#8217;t like the Internet in the 90s, perhaps. More like the 80s.</p>
<p>On the same topic, crypto companies <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/09/12/blockchain-association-lobbying-group/">formed a team lobbying effort</a>, and a high-flying crypto fund <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/olaf-carlson-wee-rode-the-bitcoin-boom-to-silicon-valley-riches-can-he-survive-the-crash-1536681364">is struggling</a> to once again post strong profit figures.</p>
<p>Moving along, Juul is back in the news. Not, however, for raising more money or posting quick growth. Well, sort of the latter, as the government is after it. The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-12/fda-threatens-to-pull-e-cigarettes-to-fight-rise-of-youth-vaping">Food and Drug Administration has put Juul on a countdown</a> to get its act together regarding teens and smoking. That the <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/juul-makes-being-a-unicorn-look-really-good/">financially impressive unicorn</a> is in as much trouble as it is, is nearly surprising.</p>
<p>Finally, we ran through the three most recent Chinese IPOs that hit our radar. Here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dianping">Meituan Dianping</a>: The Tencent-backed group buying, delivery, and everything company <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/meituan-dianping-raises-4-2b-in-hong-kong-ipo/">raised over $4 billion in its debut</a>, which was impressive, but also short of expectations. The firm won&#8217;t begin trading until the 20th, but it&#8217;s one more massive deal that got done in 2018.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/111-inc">111</a>: We spent a minute on the show discussing what counts as a technology company thanks to 111. We voted that the Chinese online-to-offline pharmacy startup did in fact count. So, it&#8217;s in our list. Some notes on its debut can be found <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/chinese-online-pharma-startup-111s-ipo-slips-after-disappointing-pricing/">here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nextev">NIO</a>: Finally on our list was NIO, a Chinese electric car company with, as we have discussed on Equity before, a shockingly short history of revenue generation. Whether the company is a <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/the-nio-ipo-looks-like-a-huge-gamble/">gamble or not</a>, it did raise $1 billion in its own offering. And its stock is off like a rocket to boot.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that was the end of things. Thanks for sticking with us, as always. Speaking of which, our 100th episode is coming up. Who should we bring onto the show to celebrate?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember 3D Touch? Unless you&#8217;re a power iOS user you probably don&#8217;t. Or, well, you&#8217;d rather not. It&#8217;s been clear for some time now that the technology <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> lauded at its 2015 unveiling as the &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/11/3d-touch-will-change-the-way-you-use-your-iphone/">next generation of multi-touch</a>&#8221; most certainly wasn&#8217;t. For the mainstream iPhone user it&#8217;s just that annoying thing that gets in the way of what you&#8217;re actually trying to do.</p>
<p>What Apple actually made with 3D Touch is the keyboard shortcut of multi-touch. Aka a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/26/3d-touch-is-apples-new-secret-weapon/">secret weapon for nerds only</a>.</p>
<p>Pro geeks might be endlessly delighted about being able to learn the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/gallery/15-super-useful-ways-to-use-3d-touch-on-the-new-iphones/">secrets of its hidden depths</a>, and shave all-important microseconds off of their highly nuanced workflows. But everyone else ignores it.</p>
<p>Or at least <em>tries</em> to ignore it &#8212; until, in the middle of trying to do something important they accidentally trigger it and get confused and annoyed about what their phone is trying to do to them.</p>
<p>Tech veterans might recall that BlackBerry (remember them?!) tried something similarly misplaced a decade ago on one of its handsets &#8212; unboxing an unlovely (and unloved) clickable touchscreen, in the one-off weirdo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DA19DNYu30">BlackBerry Storm</a>.</p>
<p>The Storm didn&#8217;t have the iconic physical BlackBerry keyboard but did have a touchscreen with on-screen qwerty keys you could still click. In short, madness!</p>
<p>Safe to say, no usage storms resulted then either &#8212; unless you&#8217;re talking about the storm of BlackBerry buyers returning to the shop demanding a replacement handset.</p>
<p>In Apple&#8217;s case, the misstep is hardly on that level. But three years on from unveiling 3D Touch, it&#8217;s now &#8216;fessing up to its own feature failure &#8212; as the latest iPhone line-up drops the pressure-sensing technology entirely<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> from the cheapest of the trio: The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/13/the-iphone-xr-is-the-one-to-get/">iPhone XR</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The lack of 3D Touch on the XR will help shave off some manufacturing cost and maybe a little thickness from the device. Mostly though it shows Apple recognizing it expended a lot of engineering effort to make something most iPhone users don&#8217;t use and don&#8217;t want to use &#8212; given, </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">as TC&#8217;s Brian Heater has called it, the iPhone XR is the iPhone for the rest of us.</span></p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t a budget handset, though. The XR does pack Apple&#8217;s next-gen biometric technology, Face ID, for instance, so contains a package of sophisticated sensor hardware lodged in its own top notch.</p>
<p>That shows Apple is not cheaping out here. Rather it&#8217;s making selective feature decisions based on what it believes iPhone users want and need. So the clear calculation in Cupertino is lots of iPhone users simply don&#8217;t need 3D Touch.</p>
<p>At the same time, company execs heaped praise on Face ID at its event this week, saying the technology has proved wildly popular with users. Yet they glossed over the simultaneous depreciation of 3D Touch at the end of the iPhone line without a word of explanation.</p>
<p>Compare the two technologies and it&#8217;s easy to see why.</p>
<p>Face ID&#8217;s popularity is hardly surprising. It&#8217;s hard to think of a simpler interaction than a look that unlocks.</p>
<p>Not so fiddly 3D Touch &#8212; which requires a press that&#8217;s more than a tap and kind of akin to a push or a little shove. Push too softly and you&#8217;ll get a tap which takes you somewhere you weren&#8217;t trying to go. But go in too hard from the start and the touchscreen starts to feel like work and/or wasted effort.</p>
<p>On top of that the sought for utility can itself feel pointless &#8212; with, for example, content previews that can be horribly slow to load, so why not just tap and look at the email in the first place?</p>
<p>With all the fingering and faffing around 3D Touch is like the Goldilocks of user interfaces: Frustration is all but guaranteed unless you have an awful lot of patience to keep going and going until you get it just right. And who, but power users, can be bothered with that?</p>
<p>For the &#8216;everyman&#8217; iPhone XR, Apple has swapped 3D Touch for a haptic feedback feature (forgettably named Haptic Touch) &#8212; that&#8217;s presumably mostly intended to be a sticking plaster to smooth out any fragmentation cracks across the iPhone estate, i.e. in the rare instances where developers have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/22/facebook-is-bringing-3d-touch-to-your-timeline/">made use of 3D Touch</a> to create in-app shortcuts that people do actually want to use.</p>
<p>If, as we&#8217;ve suggested, the iPhone XR ends up being the iPhone that ships in serious quantities there will soon be millions of iOS users without access to 3D Touch at all. So Apple is relegating the technology it once called the future of multi-touch to what it really was: An add-on power feature for pro users.</p>
<p>Pro users are also the people most likely to be willing to spend the biggest bucks on an iPhone &#8212; and so will happily shell out to own the iPhone XS or XS Max (which do retain 3D Touch, at least for now).</p>
<p>So while 3D Touch might keep incrementally helping to shift a few extra premium iPhones at the top of the range, it isn&#8217;t going to be shifting any paradigms.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the realm of rapidly evolving technologies, mobility is without doubt one of the fastest-moving. And that’s why we’re searching for up to five of the most promising early-stage mobile tech startups to apply as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/10/apply-now-to-be-a-tc-top-pick-at-disrupt-berlin-2018/">TechCrunch Top Pick</a> at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-berlin-2018/?unii-trigger-open=VP8T17">Disrupt Berlin 2018</a> on 29-30 November.</p>
<p>Whether you’re focused on drones, autonomous vehicles, sensors, apps, security or some other mobile magic, you’re on the forefront of a revolution, and we want to hear about it.

The deadline to be considered is 28 September, so don’t wait — <a href="https://apply.techcrunch.com/signin?_ga=2.207765074.1717826848.1533152245-618586988.1503595479">apply to be a TC Top Pick today</a>.</p>
<p>What’s so great about exhibiting in Startup Alley? It’s the land of opportunity.

<p>“TechCrunch uses a curation process regarding the companies it accepts, so being in Startup Alley — among all these other fantastic startups — has a hugely positive impact when you’re fundraising. We just closed $1.7 million in funding. The TechCrunch crew is fantastic — the lifeblood of the startup scene.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Singapore&#8217;s <a href="http://goldengate.vc/">Golden Gate Ventures</a> has announced the close of its newest (and third) fund for Southeast Asia at a total of $100 million.</p>
<p>The fund hit a first close in the summer, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/31/golden-gate-ventures-hits-first-close-on-new-100m-fund-for-southeast-asia/">as TechCrunch reported at the time</a>, and now it has reached full capacity. Seven-year-old Golden Gate said its LPs include existing backers Singapore sovereign fund Temasek, Korea&#8217;s Hanwha, Naver &#8212; the owner of messaging app Line &#8212; and EE Capital. Investors backing the firm for the first time through this fund include Mistletoe &#8212; the fund from Taizo Son, brother of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son &#8212; Mitsui Fudosan, IDO Investments, CTBC Group, Korea Venture Investment Corporation (KVIC), and Ion Pacific.</p>
<p>Golden Gate was founded by former Silicon Valley-based trio <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/vinnie-lauria" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="vinnie-lauria">Vinnie Lauria, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/jeffrey-paine" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="jeffrey-paine">Jeffrey Paine <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/paul-bragiel" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="paul-bragiel">Paul Bragiel <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. It has investments across five markets in Southeast Asia &#8212; with a particular focus on Indonesia and Singapore &#8212; and that portfolio includes Singapore&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/13/carousell-raises-85m/">Carousell</a>, automotive marketplace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/13/carro-raises-60m/">Carro</a>, P2P lending startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/17/funding-societies-a-southeast-asian-lending-platform-gets-25m-series-b-led-by-softbank-ventures-korea/">Funding Societies</a>, payment enabler <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/20/omise-lands-17-5m-series-b-to-expand-its-stripe-like-service-in-southeast-asia/">Omise</a> and health tech startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/alodokter">Alodokter</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/14/golden-gate-ventures-closes-new-60-million-fund-for-southeast-asia/">Golden Gate&#8217;s previous fund was $60 million</a> and it closed in 2016.</p>
<p>Some of the firm&#8217;s exits so far include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/01/alibaba-lazada-redmart-confirmed/">the sale of Redmart to Lazada</a> (although not a blockbuster), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/24/taipei-based-startup-woomoo-acqui-hired-by-priceline/">Priceline’s acquisition of Woomoo</a>, <a href="https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/business/line-acquires-indonesian-startup-temanjalan">Line’s acquisition of Temanjalan</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/14/go-jek-buys-three-startups-to-advance-its-mobile-payment-business/">the sale of Mapan (formerly Ruma) to Go-Jek</a>. It claims that its first two funds have had distributions of cash (DPI) of 1.56x and 0.13x, and IRRs of 48 percent and 29 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I compare the tech ecosystem of Southeast Asia (SEA) to other markets, it’s really hit an inflection point &#8212; annual investment is now measured in the billions. That puts SEA on a global stage with the US, China, and India. Yet there is a youthfulness that reminds me of Silicon Valley circa 2005, shortly before social media and the iPhone took off,&#8221; Lauria said in a statement.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/12/google-southeast-asias-internet-economy-is-growing-faster-than-expected/">A report from Google and Temasek forecasts</a> that Southeast Asia&#8217;s digital economy will grow from $50 billion in 2017 to over $200 billion by 2025 as internet penetration continues to grow across the region thanks to increased ownership of smartphones. That opportunity to reach a cumulative population of over 600 million consumers &#8212; more of whom are online today than the entire U.S. population &#8212; is feeding optimism around startups and tech companies.</p>
<p>Golden Gate isn&#8217;t alone in developing a fund to explore those possibilities, there&#8217;s plenty of VC activity in the region.</p>
<p>Some of those include Openspace, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/25/singapore-nsi-ventures-is-now-opensapce/">formerly known as NSI Ventures</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/14/openspace-ventures-closes-135m-fund/">just closed a $135 million fund</a>, Qualgro, which is<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/21/qualgro-100-million-fund/"> raising a $100 million vehicle</a> and Golden Equator, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/15/gec-kip-fund-southeast-asia-88-million/">paired up with Korea Investment Partners on a joint $88 million fund.</a> Temasek-affiliated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/10/vertex-ventures-210-million-southeast-asia-india/">Vertex closed a $210 million fund</a> last year and that remains a record for Southeast Asia.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/10/golden-gate-ventures-lunex-crypto/">Golden Gate also has a dedicated crypto fund</a>, LuneX, which is in the process of raising $10 million.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt, regulator <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/jina-choi" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="jina-choi">Jina Choi, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> who heads the SEC&#8217;s wide-reaching San Francisco unit, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/the-sec-has-never-been-busier-investigating-both-private-and-public-companies-in-the-bay-area-suggests-agency-head/">declined to confirm or deny</a> that the SEC is investigating Tesla CEO Elon Musk for possible fraud.</p>
<p>Said Choi, &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you about any particular investigation in our office. And I can&#8217;t confirm or deny the existence of investigations that are in our office. I can say that we are very diligent about covering the issuers in our region and some of the more high-profile issuers in our region. We try to stay on top of that, but that&#8217;s about all I can say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, investor James Anderson of the global asset manager <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-stake/saudi-sovereign-fund-builds-3-to-5-percent-stake-in-tesla-ft-idUSKBN1KS1UG">Baillie Gifford</a> tells Reuters that, as a shareholder, he was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-musk-investor/tesla-investor-says-sec-asked-it-about-funding-secured-tweet-idUSKCN1LS2RD">recently questioned</a> by U.S. securities regulators about Musk’s famous &#8212; and possibly fateful &#8212; early August tweet that he was thinking of taking Tesla private and that he had &#8220;funding secured.&#8221;</p>
<p>Said Anderson to Reuters, &#8220;I don’t know what they’ll do with [Musk], but there’s no implication that we’ve done anything wrong . . . I think quite naturally they wanted to know whether major shareholders had any lead indication or knowledge of the tweet about ‘funding secured.’”</p>
<p>Because it isn&#8217;t talking, it&#8217;s impossible to know how seriously the SEC is looking into the chain of events that led to the tweet or what followed. As industry watchers likely know, days after making his surprising announcement, Musk <a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-saudi-fund-asked-about-taking-tesla-private-1534166024">elaborated</a> on why he made it, <a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/update-taking-tesla-private?mod=article_inline">writing in a </a><a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/update-taking-tesla-private">post</a> that he&#8217;d left a late July meeting with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund that gave him the impression that a deal to take Tesla private could close.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/public-bravado-private-doubts-how-elon-musks-tesla-plan-unraveled-1535326249">tick-tock account</a> by the WSJ of what happened behind the scenes during this period &#8212;  it was published shortly after Musk abandoned his take-private idea &#8212; said officials in the kingdom were &#8220;rankled&#8221; by the suggestion that the Saudis, who have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-stake/saudi-sovereign-fund-builds-3-to-5-percent-stake-in-tesla-ft-idUSKBN1KS1UG">quietly acquired up to 5 percent</a> of Tesla&#8217;s shares this year, had made any kind of formal proposal.</p>
<p>Bruised feelings aside, Musk, it&#8217;s now plain, may be dealing with regulatory fall-out, too. And interestingly, much of what happens next may center not just on interviews with shareholders and Musk&#8217;s other communications, but on plain-old psychology.</p>
<p>Onstage, we asked Choi if, typically speaking, false statements are enough to prove fraud or whether there needs to be an accompanying scheme. &#8220;When you talk about fraud,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;you&#8217;re talking about a state of mind, you&#8217;re talking about mens rea. We call it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scienter">scienter</a>. You have to do something with intentionality. The idea of just making a misstatement doesn&#8217;t necessarily rise to the level of fraud. I think that&#8217;s what makes our investigations so challenging. I think the idea of trying to understand what&#8217;s in people&#8217;s heads can be very difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>Misstatements can &#8220;be the first step to fraud,&#8221; Choi had added. &#8220;But generally, when we talk about fraud the F word, I think we are talking about a state of mind that&#8217;s a little bit higher than that.&#8221;</p>

Yes!</p>
<p>In a Nintendo Direct, the company let fly a number of games and a couple of original titles. The biggest Nintendo-produced titles we had glimpses of are a new Animal Crossing in development for the Switch and Luigi&#8217;s Mansion 3.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-1712388 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-13-at-4.48.23-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="375" /></p>
<p>We learned next to nothing about the new Animal Crossing, other than that it&#8217;s coming in 2019, but we did get to see some gameplay from the latest chapter of Luigi&#8217;s only titular adventure in the Nintendo world. Luigi&#8217;s Mansion 3 seems to follow in the ghost-vacuuming footsteps of its predecessors with the bizarre camera angles and all. It&#8217;s also heading to the Switch stage in 2019, setting up a couple of Nintendo titles for us to look forward to next year, possibly alongside Metroid Prime 4 (?).</p>
<p>Other familiar additions to the Switch include a port of the Wii U game New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe coming in January and Yoshi’s Crafted World coming in spring 2019.</p>

<p>Aside from the Nintendo-made titles, fans were served up a big surprise with the announcement that some recent and old-school Final Fantasy titles are coming to the Switch. Final Fantasy VII, IX, X, X-2 HD Remaster and XII are all arriving in 2019.</p>
<p>There are about a dozen other incoming titles (several of which are remasters), including EA SPORTS FIFA 19, Starlink: Battle for Atlas, Diablo III: Eternal Collection, Mega Man 11, Katamari Damacy REROLL and plenty of others that you can jump through in the Direct below.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/CRuHg1dv8MI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch is a fantastic system, and while it has a lot going for it, I barely have any games to play for it anymore. It&#8217;s not all that out of character for Nintendo to delay the hell out of the instant gratification its customers want, but the Switch has had a particularly stuttered content rollout since its launch. Hopefully the company can pick up a little more consistent cadence as it gets more third-party studios onboard.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The news that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nintendo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nintendo">Nintendo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> would be adding NES games to the Switch as part of its paid online service had a mixed reception, but the company has completely made up for this controversial decision by releasing wireless NES controllers with which to play those games. At $60 they&#8217;re a bit steep, but come on. You know you&#8217;re going to buy them eventually. Probably next week.</p>
<p>The controllers were revealed during the latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/nintendo-direct/09-13-2018/">Nintendo Direct video news</a> dump, alongside a host of other nostalgia bombs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/13/nintendo-finally-announces-some-more-new-games-for-the-switch/">like a new Animal Crossing and about a million Final Fantasy ports</a>. But first the details of those sweet, sweet controllers.</p>
<p><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712379" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/controllerhero.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="534" />They&#8217;re definitely NES-style down to the buttons, meaning they aren&#8217;t going to replace your existing Switch Joy-Cons. So why do they cost so much? Because Nintendo. At least they&#8217;re wireless and they charge up by slotting onto the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/switch-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="switch-2">Switch&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> sides like Joy-Cons. And they <em>do</em> have shoulder buttons, though, for some reason.</p>
<p><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712358" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/controllers2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="614" />You&#8217;ll be able to pre-order a two-pack starting on the 18th for $60, which also happens to be the launch date for Nintendo Switch Online. Yeah, it&#8217;s time to fork out for that online play Nintendo has generously given away for so long.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as you may remember <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/07/nintendo-switch-online-costs-20-per-year-and-comes-with-20-online-playable-nes-games/">from previous announcements</a>, the cost is pretty low; $20 per year, and it gets you online game access and a growing library of NES classics. Ten of those games were confirmed before, but 10 more were added to the list today.</p>
<p><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712360" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/nintendo-online.png" alt="" width="1024" height="502" />So at launch you&#8217;ll be able to play:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Balloon Fight</em></li>
<li><em>Dr Mario</em></li>
<li><em>Mario Bros.</em></li>
<li><em>Super Mario Bros.</em></li>
<li><em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em></li>
<li><em>Donkey Kong</em></li>
<li><em>Ice Climber</em></li>
<li><em>The Legend of Zelda</em></li>
<li><em>Tennis</em></li>
<li><em>Soccer</em></li>
<li><em>Baseball</em></li>
<li><em>Double Dragon</em></li>
<li><em>Excitebike</em></li>
<li><em>Ghosts &#8216;n Goblins</em></li>
<li><em>Gradius</em></li>
<li><em>Ice Hockey</em></li>
<li><em>Pro Wrestling</em></li>
<li><em>River City Ransom</em></li>
<li><em>Tecmo Bowl</em></li>
<li><em>Yoshi</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The service will also enable cloud backups of saves and possible special deals down the line. It sounds like it&#8217;s basically a must-have, although plenty of people are angry that their virtual console games have been essentially stolen back from them. At least we have the NES and SNES Classic Editions.</p>
