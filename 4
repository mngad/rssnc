				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.teikametrics.com">Teikametrics</a> is a Boston-based startup that helps retailers tackle the challenges of advertising on Amazon. Today, the company is announcing that it has raised $10 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>CEO Alasdair McLean-Foreman said third-party sellers represent 60 percent of the transactions on Amazon. But they don&#8217;t have any real data science capabilities, so they need help advertise their goods in a way that maximizes profitability.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are using big data to help sellers optimize for profitability,&#8221; McLean-Foreman said. He compared it to the work that Amazon has done &#8220;optimizing on the consumer side — all the advanced econometrics&#8221; to determine things like the price of Amazon Prime. &#8220;We’re on the other side. We’re helping sellers and brands.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a very different challenge from optimizing Facebook ads to get the most clicks. McLean-Foreman argued that it&#8217;s not even something Amazon can do properly, because, &#8220;They don’t have critical information on cost of goods sold, and they also don&#8217;t have the context of being on the supply chain side.&#8221;</p>
<p>(At the same time, he emphasized, &#8220;We’re aligned with Amazon, we&#8217;re pro-Amazon and we&#8217;ve built our company off the back of Amazon.&#8221;)</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xHdqoaOYSrI" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>In contrast, Teikametrics — through its &#8220;retail optimization platform&#8221; Flywheel — allows sellers to incorporate things like transaction data, inventory data and pricing data. So when they look at the results of of their campaigns, they can see their gross profit margins and profitability after ad spend.</p>
<p>How appealing is this to sellers? Well Teikametrics says it&#8217;s being used by advertisers who represent 1 percent of all sales on Amazon, including brands like Razer, Power Practical and Zipline Ski. Eventually, the company plans to expand its technology beyond Amazon, to other marketplaces.</p>
<p>Teikametrics has been bootstrapped since its founding in 2013, at least until now. McLean-Foreman said he decided to raise outside funding because &#8220;the crown jewel is the sheer amount of data that we can model,&#8221; which means hiring &#8220;a tremendous amount of very, very high-powered machine learning folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Series A funding was led by Granite Point Capital, Jump Capital and FJ Lab.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A growing number of states has legalized retail marijuana sales, but ensuring that everything works as advertised is no easy task. Among the many things that regulators have to concern themselves with are: granting licenses to dispensaries, retail sales, delivery, distribution, ensuring marijuana has been tested for pesticides and other materials, and other parts of the cannabis supply system.</p>
<p>In California, the software system that&#8217;s being used statewide to record the inventory and movement of cannabis and cannabis products through the commercial cannabis supply chain is made by <a href="https://www.metrc.com/">Metrc</a>, a low-flying, five-year-old, Lakeland, Florida company. In fact, Metrc now services 11 states altogether, including Colorado, Oregon, Alaska, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, and Louisiana. It&#8217;s also used by regulators in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the kind of traction that investors notice, and indeed, today Metrc is announcing its first outside round of funding, in the form of $50 million from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiger-global" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tiger-global">Tiger Global Management <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Casa Verde Ventures, the three-year-old, cannabis-focused venture firm that was famously cofounded by rapper Snoop Dogg but is largely managed by Goldman Sachs and Nomura Securities alum Karan Wadhera.</p>
<p>Wadhera tells us he&#8217;d been following Metrc for a &#8220;number of years as it became one of the de facto track-and-trace systems&#8221; for government entities that regulate the cannabis industry. Eventually, he introduced to the company Tiger, with which Case Verde &#8220;shares deal flow quite regularly,&#8221; says Wadhera, pointing to another co-investment the two firms have made together in <a href="https://www.greenbits.com/">Green Bits</a>, a maker of point-of-sale software for dispensaries. (Worth noting: Green Bits launched at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/22/green-bits-launches-point-of-sale-service-for-cannabis-shops/">TechCrunch Disrupt in 2015</a>.)</p>
<p>Certainly, that kind of working relationship helps, but the supply chain expertise of Metrc CEO Jeff Wells also presumably gave Tiger and Casa Verde confidence in their investment. Not so long ago, Metrc was part of a larger company called Franwell that was founded by Wells in 1993 and that quickly began developing products for the RFID market. More specifically, Wells tells us, Franwell began focusing on cold chain management and fresh foods, building up resources, research, and knowledge along the way . &#8212; including about regulated markets &#8212; that he believes gives an edge to its clients today, including those of Metrc.</p>
<p>As for how Metrc will use its fresh capital, Wells says the company plans to remain focused solely on regulators but to &#8220;look to expand our regulatory focus,&#8221; including, eventually, by potentially expanding into &#8220;other regulated markets and products that need the type of tools that Metrc has created.&#8221; The company, which currently employs roughly 100 people, also expects to work eventually with both domestic and international regulators.</p>
<p>Surely, as more state and sovereign governments legalize cannabis, compliance will play an even more critical role. Says Wadhera of the deal, &#8220;Compliance is the backbone of the cannabis industry. If a license holder isn&#8217;t compliant, their business will cease to exist.&#8221; That&#8217;s good for proponents of greater accessibility to cannabis. It&#8217;s good for consumers who can be better assured that the products they&#8217;re buying is safe. For Metrc and now Tiger and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/casa-verde-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="casa-verde-capital">Casa Verde Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> that&#8217;s also good for business.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitch continues to dominate the live streaming market, with approximately 2.5 billion hours watched by viewers in the third quarter of 2018, according to a new industry report out this morning. While YouTube still trails, it&#8217;s begun to close the gap with Twitch, it appears. YouTube&#8217;s live streaming platform, YouTube Live, started the year with 15 percent of the overall live streaming market&#8217;s viewership, but by September 2018, it had grown to roughly 25 percent of all live streaming hours viewed.</p>
<p>These findings, and more, were the subject of a &#8220;state of the industry&#8221; report released today by <a href="http://www.streamelements.com/">StreamElements</a>, which also dug into what&#8217;s making these live streaming sites tick.</p>
<p>Of course, Twitch is still the market leader, with around 750 million monthly viewers, on average, who watched over 813 million hours in September. YouTube Live, by comparison, saw over 226 million hours that month, and Microsoft&#8217;s Mixer saw just 13+ million.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1737429" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/streaming-hours-watched-q3-2018.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="343" /></p>
<p>Also of note is that Twitch&#8217;s growth is now coming from the long tail, the report claims. Its top 100 channels haven&#8217;t grown much since the beginning of the year &#8211; in fact, they&#8217;re down a bit, according to the findings. In January 2018, viewers watch around 262 million hours on the top 100, which dropped to 254 million in September.</p>
<p>In addition, Twitch is growing viewership thanks to its expanded focus outside of gaming content. IRL streaming &#8211; meaning, watching creators &#8220;in real life&#8221; going about their day, vlogging, or participating in other activities, for example &#8211; is now one of the site&#8217;s most consistently growing categories, with 41 million more hours watched in Q3 2018 than in Q1.</p>
<p>This growth likely impacted Twitch&#8217;s recent decision to do away with the overarching &#8220;IRL&#8221; category to instead break down the content into subcategories like music, food &amp; drink, ASMR, beauty, and more, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/10/twitch-is-closing-its-communities/">other organizational changes</a> to its site.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1737431" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/irl-hours-watched.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="349" /></p>
<p>StreamElements also claims that game streams and other content &#8211; but not the competitions known as &#8220;esports&#8221; &#8211;  are what&#8217;s attracting viewers.</p>
<p>Esports viewership now makes up 9 to 17 percent of overall Twitch viewership, the report says. (This is consistent with <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/esports-drives-21-3-of-twitch-viewership/">findings</a> Newzoo has reported in past years, as well.)</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1737432" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/twitch-esports-2018.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="384" /></p>
<p>The report&#8217;s data, however, is not first-party &#8211; it comes from StreamElements&#8217; position as a production and community management solutions provider for live streamers, which allows it some insight into live streaming trends. The company also partnered with streaming analysts <a href="http://www.streamhatchet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.streamhatchet.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1540563642410000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEdDbUdkrvZ1DwaBp2Wlht8cnKL6g">StreamHatchet</a> to compile this report, it says.</p>
<p>That being said, it&#8217;s not the only one to point to YouTube&#8217;s more recent growth. In StreamLabs&#8217; <a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/livestreaming-q218-report-streamlabs-obs-doubles-tipping-breaks-record-36m-twitch-hits-1m-ef41d2c61923">Q2 report this year</a>, it also found that YouTube&#8217;s live gaming streams were on the rise, as was viewership. But StreamLabs tends to look at concurrent streams and viewership, so it&#8217;s not a direct comparison.</p>
<p>YouTube recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/18/youtube-to-shut-down-standalone-gaming-app-as-gaming-gets-a-new-home-on-youtube/">did away with its standalone YouTube Gaming app</a>, and incorporated gaming content more directly into its main site. This could impact its future growth even more than is reflected in this Q3-focused report.</p>
<p>Finally, the report also found that Fortnite&#8217;s popularity may have peaked &#8211; it&#8217;s still the most watched game on Twitch, but since reaching over 151 million hours watched in July, it&#8217;s been shedding viewers. The game saw 20 million fewer hours viewed in August, then dropped by another 25 million hours in September.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[ShopRunner has raised $40 million and confirmed its acquisition of ecommerce marketplace Spring.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/shoprunner" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="shoprunner">ShopRunner <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> chief executive <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samyagan/">Sam Yagan</a> conquered the online dating world. Can he conquer the e-commerce world, too?</p>
<p>Hot off the heels of its first profitable year, ShopRunner is announcing its first infusion of venture funding under Yagan, an acquisition of the shopping app <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/spring-is" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="spring-is">Spring <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and, sources tell TechCrunch, it&#8217;s readying a major overhaul to its mobile app, signaling what could be a new era for the company.</p>
<p>Yagan, the co-founder of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/okcupid" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="okcupid">OkCupid, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> former CEO and vice chairman of The Match Group and managing director of the venture fund <a href="http://www.corazoncap.com/about.html">Corazon Capital</a> joined <a href="https://www.shoprunner.com/">ShopRunner</a> in 2016 to test the waters of online retail.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at founding OkCupid, running Match and incubating Tinder, arguably, I had my hands on the three most important dating businesses ever,&#8221; Yagan told TechCrunch. &#8220;Finally, I was like, &#8216;what else is there?&#8217; I am either going to the grave as the online dating guy, or this was the moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yagan replaced former <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/paypal" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="paypal">PayPal <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> president Scott Thompson as ShopRunner&#8217;s CEO, moved the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/alibaba" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="alibaba">Alibaba <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-backed subscription-based digital shopping company from Silicon Valley to his hometown, Chicago, and readied for battle against Amazon.</p>
<p>ShopRunner teams with mid- to high-end retailers to offer its paying members free two-day shipping and free returns on their sites, taking a small cut of each purchase. As much as it might like to, it doesn&#8217;t compete with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Prime. It doesn&#8217;t even have a centralized marketplace where users can shop all the ShopRunner partner brands at once, but that may change.</p>
<p>This week, it announced a $40 million investment from August Capital, bringing its total equity funding to around $140 million since it was founded in 2009. The company says it plans to use the cash for product development, data science and to amp up its M&amp;A strategy. It&#8217;s already begun the latter, confirming to TechCrunch that it&#8217;s acquired Alan and David Tisch&#8217;s <a href="https://www.shopspring.com">Spring,</a> a deal first reported by <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/10/5/17939860/shoprunner-spring-acquisition-michael-rubin-david-tisch">Recode</a>.</p>
<p>Yagan declined to disclose both ShopRunner&#8217;s latest valuation and the terms of the Spring acquisition. Though he did say ShopRunner&#8217;s valuation is in the &#8220;hundreds of millions&#8221; range and that they had purchased Spring&#8217;s platform and 30 of its employees, a majority of which are engineers.</p>
<p>ShopRunner did not take on all of Spring&#8217;s employees. Why? Yagan said it was because the two were similar companies and there wasn&#8217;t a need for Spring&#8217;s entire team. As a result, Spring&#8217;s remaining employees, a mix of engineers and otherwise, are joining real estate tech startup <a href="https://www.compass.com/">Compass</a> as part of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/real-estate-upstart-compass-acquires-part-of-shopping-app-spring-including-20-engineers-and-cto/">separate transaction</a>, Spring&#8217;s CEO<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alantisch/"> Alan Tisch</a> confirmed to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Backed with $105 million in VC funding, Spring had reportedly struggled to scale and had drifted from the <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/spiral-springs-great-mobile-experiment/">mobile-first strategy</a> it touted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/14/spring-david-tischs-latest-venture-is-instagram-for-shopping/">right out of the gate</a>. TechCrunch&#8217;s Ingrid Lunden has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/real-estate-upstart-compass-acquires-part-of-shopping-app-spring-including-20-engineers-and-cto/"> more on this</a> and Compass&#8217; acquihire.</p>

<p>ShopRunner and Spring had some preexisting ties. Recode reports that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/michael-rubin-5" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="michael-rubin-5">Michael Rubin, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the billionaire owner of ShopRunner via <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kynetic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kynetic">Kynetic, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> ShopRunner&#8217;s parent company, is close friends with Alan. Moving forward, Alan is serving as an advisor to ShopRunner, while Spring&#8217;s president Marshall Porter will continue to lead the startup.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shopping on your phone isn&#8217;t fun and it&#8217;s not easy,&#8221; Alan told TechCrunch. &#8220;And many of the brands that people love and shop every day you can&#8217;t find on Amazon. We wanted to create an experience that was as fun and easy as walking into a great store. We still don&#8217;t feel today that the dream has been fully realized but we think combining the scale of ShopRunner and the product Spring has really puts us in the position to make that happen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>By pairing up with Spring, ShopRunner is multiplying the number of brands available to its paying members by 10 and offering, for the first time, an actual marketplace where customers can gain access to hundreds of those brands at once.</p>
<p>For now, both companies will continue to operate independently, but Yagan says they will revisit whether to fully merge the platforms in 2019.</p>
<p>Spring is ShopRunner&#8217;s first major M&amp;A deal, but won&#8217;t be its last. Yagan said they have their eyes peeled for any-point solutions that help retailers take on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/jeff-bezos" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="jeff-bezos">Jeff Bezos, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> or that have large member bases and provide a great shopping experience.</p>
<p>Finally, according to sources familiar with the company, ShopRunner is planning to unveil a major update to its mobile app in November. Historically, users weren&#8217;t able to access ShopRunner brands via its app, making it an essentially useless piece of the company&#8217;s product. The update, coupled with the acquisition of Spring, will put ShopRunner on the path toward creating a digital mall with frictionless payments, a necessary step forward for the aspiring Amazon competitor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google Maps has been steadily rolling out new features to make its app more than just a way to find places and navigate to them. In recent months, it&#8217;s added things like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/google-launches-its-group-planning-feature-for-maps/">group trip planning</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/01/google-maps-adds-commute-tab-and-music-controls/">music controls</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/01/google-maps-adds-commute-tab-and-music-controls/">commuter tools</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/18/google-maps-eta-sharing-feature-hits-ios/">ETA sharing</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/26/the-new-google-maps-with-personalized-recommendations-is-now-live/">personalized recommendations</a>, and more. Now, it&#8217;s introducing a new way for users to follow their favorite businesses, as well &#8211; like restaurants, bars, or stores, for example &#8211; in order to stay on top of their news and updates.</p>
<p>If that sounds a lot like Google Maps&#8217; own version of Facebook Pages, you&#8217;re right.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.blog.google/products/maps/fresh-ways-stay-date-your-favorite-places-and-find-new-ones/">Explains the company</a>, once you tap the new &#8220;follow&#8221; to track a business, you&#8217;ll then be able to see news from those places like their upcoming events, their offers, and other updates right in the &#8220;For You&#8221; tab on Google Maps.</p>
<p>Events, deals and photo-filled posts designed to encourage foot traffic? That definitely sounds like a Facebook Page competitor aimed at the brick-and-mortar crowd.</p>
<p>Businesses can also use the Google Maps platform to start reaching potential customers before they open to the public, Google notes.</p>
<p><img class="vertical alignnone size-large wp-image-1737407" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/agmm_follow.gif?w=280" alt="" width="280" height="498" /></p>
<p>After building a Business Profile using <a href="https://www.google.com/business/">Google My Business</a> which includes their opening date, the business will then be surfaced in users&#8217; searches on mobile web and in the app, up to three months before their opening.</p>
<p>This profile will display the opening date in orange just below the business name, and users can save the business to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/13/google-maps-lets-you-save-and-share-favorite-places-with-launch-of-lists/">one of their lists,</a> if they choose. Users can also view all the other usual business information, like address, phone, website and photos.</p>
<p>The new &#8220;follow&#8221; feature will be accessible to the over 150 million places already on Google Maps, as well as the millions of users who are seeking them out.</p>
<p>The feature has been spotted in the wild for some time before Google&#8217;s official announcement this week, and is rolling out over the next few weeks, initially on Android.</p>
<p>The &#8220;For You&#8221; tab is currently available in limited markets, with more countries coming soon, says Google.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Can’t wait to get your giant hand on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/palm-returns-as-an-ultra-mobile-smartphone/">Palm’s tiny “ultra-mobile?”</a> Turns out it will be arriving sooner than later — next Friday, in fact. Verizon (you know, the giant telecom that owns the media conglomerate that owns TechCrunch) announced today that it will be launching the strange new thing <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/introducing-palm-worlds-first-ultra-mobile-companion-your-smartphone-exclusively-verizon">on November 2</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 3.3-inch device runs $349 off-contract. On-contract, it’s $14.58 a month for two years. It will be available through the carrier’s stores o through Best Buy kiosks. The companies are also betting big on accessories, from companies including Kate Spade, Zagg, LifeActiv and some Verizon-branded products.</span></p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><img class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1732289" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CMB_50041.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Makes sense, as the device is being positioned as somewhere between a smartphone and smartwatch, given its small size. It’s novel, for sure, the notion of what’s essentially a smaller, second phone. It’s also fairly retro, both from the standpoint of the startup licensing out the familiar name and the fact that it sports roughly the same size screen as the original iPhone. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I know I’m excited to try the thing out. The built quality is certainly there from my initial impressions, and you can’t really go wrong with a design that looks like nothing more than a shrunk down iPhone. Of course, the company has painted itself into a bit of a corner with a single carrier launch for a device that already includes a number of barriers to entry.</span></p>
<p><img class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1732274" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SC30_3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, with the run that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkFOV1fFycY">Steph’s been having lately,</a> maybe they’ll pull it off, after all. </span></p>

<p>According to Cheddar, Rate My Professors is being used by more than 6 million college students per month, who write an average of 125,000 new professor and class ratings monthly. Seasonally, these figures peak at 7 million and 300,000, respectively.</p>
<p>The site traffic has been steadily growing year-over-year, and it now boasts 20 million total ratings across 1.8 million professors. Its iOS app has thousands of reviews, and a 4.8 star rating, as well.</p>
<p>Cheddar already has big plans for its new purchase, promising a site redesign and a set of features for professors, it says.</p>
<p>“Rate My Professors is a trusted tool for millions of students each month; we’re excited to redesign the site, improve the user experience, and offer students a better toolset to search, evaluate and compare professors” said Eric Harris, President and Chief Operating Officer of Cheddar, in a statement. “In 2019, we also plan to offer educators a premium toolset similar to those offered to employers by Glassdoor.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1737387" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rate-my-professors.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="347" /></p>
<p>Despite the overlap in demographics, the site isn&#8217;t the most obvious choice for Cheddar, whose key focus to date has been on its streaming news networks.</p>
<p>Today, Cheddar operates two live video networks: the business news network Cheddar, which often scoops tech news stories; and the newer Cheddar Big News, which is its fast-paced general and headline news network. These channels are carried across streaming TV and video services, like Sling TV, Hulu, YouTube TV, fuboTV, Philo, and Amazon and on social platforms like Snapchat, Twitch, Facebook, and Twitter.</p>
<p>It also operates the place-based CheddarU network across 1,600 on 600 campuses &#8211; or a reach of 9 million students.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Cheddar says it&#8217;s bringing in Taboola as a strategic in-feed discovery partner for Cheddar’s Rate My Professors. Taboola says it will bring an infinite scrolling experience to the site, through its Taboola Feed &#8211; a personalized experience designed for those who grew up scrolling through social media.</p>
<p>Rate My Professors is not the first move Cheddar has made recently as a part of a strategy to reach the coveted younger demographic.</p>
<p>It <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180531006333/en/CheddarU-Million-Students-600-Campuses-1600-Screens">also in May 2018 bought Viacom’s MTV Networks on Campus</a>, the distribution platform for Viacom’s campus-based service, MTVU &#8211; which then became CheddarU. Chegg and Pandora were launch partners, with Chegg collaborating on programming focused on education and study, and Pandora on daily coverage of artists, playlists and music charts.</p>
<p>With the new acquisition, Cheddar gains a user-generated content site that has a strong direct-to-consumer relationship, Cheddar CEO Jon Steinberg tells us.</p>
<p>&#8220;We already have a superior model to traditional ad-supported media companies &#8211; we are in premium skinny bundles next to CNN and CNBC and focused on live, not page views. Everyone, even NBC is chasing us&#8230;but we are one step ahead!,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Deal terms were not disclosed. Cheddar told <a href="https://www.axios.com/cheddar-acquires-rate-my-professors-ab0ae547-30d5-4329-b007-bd5131e28a46.html">Axios</a> it&#8217;s on track for nearly $30 million in revenue this year, up from the $25 million it estimated in July.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><img class="breakout alignnone wp-image-1737383 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-550274689.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="729" /></p>
<p>About 800 kilometers of unused fiber optic cable running down the U.S. eastern seaboard is set to become the first stateside quantum network.</p>
<p>The aim is to get the quantum network up and running and accepting customers by the end of the year, making it the first time that quantum keys will be exchanged commercially on U.S. soil.</p>
<p>Quantum Xchange, a Bethesda, Maryland-based quantum communications provider, has inked a deal for Zayo, a fiber network giant, to provide the stretch of fiber from Boston to Washington, DC. Its first aim is to help connect Wall Street financiers with their back operations in nearby New Jersey, but the hope is that other industries — from healthcare to critical infrastructure — will soon use the network for their own secure communications.</p>
<p>Quantum cryptography and networking aren&#8217;t new concepts, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/18/theres-now-proof-that-quantum-computers-can-outperform-classical-machines/">have risen to prominence in recent years</a> as both a threat to some encryption and also the savior of future secure communications. Relying on photons and the laws of quantum physics to share encryption keys over a long distance from one place to another makes it significantly harder to intercept the keys without breaking the beam or perfectly cloning a copy. This technique, known as quantum key distribution (QKD), is seen as a likely contender for the future of end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p>Although quantum cryptography has been around for years, it&#8217;s only been recently that scientists and computer engineers have harnessed the technology for practical uses. Soon, the technology could be used for protecting elections, transmitting payments and securing communications between data centers — even from satellites back to earth.</p>
<p>Europe has already <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612327/europes-quest-for-an-unhackable-quantum-internet/">seen some success</a> in building a small-scale quantum network, but &#8220;shortcomings&#8221; made bringing the system to the U.S. more difficult, said Quantum Xchange chief executive John Prisco.</p>
<p>His company uses trusted node technology that passes quantum key data from point to point over a larger distance, making it easier to scale a quantum network over wider geographical spaces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Organizations with offices in Boston will be able to send secure communications to a partner in D.C., and eventually even further – as the goal is to keep buying up optical fiber that is already in the ground all over the country so that we can provide a secure quantum network that will serve the entire nation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Prisco said it&#8217;s &#8220;critical&#8221; to establish a quantum key distribution network as a defensive measure &#8220;before the unprecedented power of quantum computers become an offensive weapon.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Big problems require big war chests. <a href="https://www.ribbonhome.com">Ribbon</a> wants the biggest chest of them all.</p>
<p>The startup, which was founded just about a year ago by ex-LendingClub head of strategic development Shaival Shah and ex-Twitter/TellApart engineer Jian Wei Gan (who, full disclosure, is married to TechCrunch columnist Joyce Yang), wants to replace the incredible stress of securing a mortgage during the home buying process with a Ribbon Offer: If a buyer can’t secure a mortgage in time for close, Ribbon will pay for the house itself and give the buyer extra time to get financing.</p>
<p>It’s a simple premise, but potentially revolutionary in its effect on home buying in the United States, and Ribbon’s investors have taken notice. After raising a small seed earlier this year, the company announced today that it has raised $225 million in a combination of debt and Series A equity financing. (The company refused to go on the record about the breakdown of debt and equity.) The equity portion was led by its existing seed investors Bain Capital Ventures, Greylock, NFX and NYCA.</p>
<p>Understanding Ribbon requires understanding the immense difficulties of consumer home buying. <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/06/30/business/poll-home-ownership.html">Home ownership remains a dream for most Americans</a>, but actually purchasing a home in the United States remains incredibly challenging. From finding a home to negotiating with a seller and handling hundreds of pages of paperwork — all of it together can create one of the most stressful periods of anyone’s life.</p>
<p>And it is getting even more intense. For consumers buying homes, their competitors are often not their fellow humans, but rather large investment firms that come with all-cash offers and guarantees to close. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-your-new-landlord-wall-street-1500647417">As The Wall Street Journal noted last year</a> in a deep dive on the practice, “All told, big investors have spent some $40 billion buying about 200,000 houses, renovating them and building rental-management businesses, estimates real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors LLC.”</p>
<p>That has made mortgage financing — necessary for most buyers — an increasingly common no-go for home sellers. To solve for this, <a href="https://www.ribbonhome.com">Ribbon</a> wants to give every consumer the leverage of an all-cash offer while eliminating the mortgage contingency in home buying.</p>
<div id="attachment_1737370" style="width: 349px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="vertical size-large wp-image-1737370" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ios-app-home-for-client.png?w=339" alt="" width="339" height="680" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ribbon&#8217;s app allows home buyers to find houses and determine Ribbon Offer prices (Photo from Ribbon)</p></div>
<p>When purchasing a home, buyers who need mortgage financing will include a clause in the home purchase contract stating that if they are unable to get a mortgage in time for closing, they are able to walk away from a deal, generally without financial penalty. This is known as a mortgage contingency.</p>
<p>That clause puts sellers in a bind: move forward with such a buyer, and their creditworthiness will determine whether a transaction is completed. Yet, sellers don’t really know their buyers, and they have very little visibility into a buyer’s ability to get a mortgage. Pre-approved mortgages help here, when they are available, but are a poor substitute for cash.</p>
<p>Ribbon takes on home buyers as clients and assesses their likelihood of securing a mortgage using data science. If convinced that a buyer will get a mortgage, it then offers a Ribbon guarantee to the seller that if financing falls through, it will offer the cash needed to close the transaction.</p>
<p>“We guarantee a close and we guarantee a move in,” explained Shah, who is CEO. He emphasized that “we are not just providing a cash offer, but a guarantee to close … which creates certainty in the real estate process.”</p>
<div id="attachment_1737372" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1737372" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/7612-Bosham-home.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" /><p class="wp-caption-text">One of Ribbon&#8217;s early purchases was this home (Photo from Ribbon)</p></div>
<p>Ribbon is free for buyers, and the company charges a 1.95 percent fee at closing from sellers. It is not uncommon for home sellers to discount their home price for all-cash offers due to the greater certainty of close, and Ribbon believes the same pattern will hold true for its Ribbon Offer. “Our view is that if discounts are going to exist because of the cash guarantee … let that discount flow through to the consumer ecosystem,” Shah explained.</p>
<p>If a mortgage falls through at the last minute, Ribbon will buy the home and wait for the buyer to secure a different mortgage. That process can sometimes be just a few days, which means that Ribbon doesn’t need to hold substantial housing inventory or take on macroeconomic risk, and can turn over its debt quite rapidly.</p>
<p>The company launched in Charlotte, North Carolina and has been in the market for about six months. Shah said that the company “tripled” transaction volume from Q2 to Q3, although demurred on deeper details of the company’s revenues. Charlotte was chosen both because home prices are cheaper than in major global cities like New York City and San Francisco, and because the percentage of cash offers locally has hovered slightly above one-third in recent years, according to company data, due to a surge in corporate buying.</p>
<p>Ribbon wants to be “Switzerland” according to Shah, which means working with existing realtors and existing mortgage lenders in a neutral and non-competitive way. He doesn’t see a world in which the company would offer its own mortgage products (at least, not yet), and instead wants to focus on perfecting the data models that underwrite its guarantee.</p>
<p>Home buying startups have been heavily financed by venture capitalists, including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/opendoor-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="opendoor-2">Opendoor, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which has raised $1 billion, and others like Perch and Knock. Shah says that his competitors primarily focus on sellers rather than buyers, and Ribbon wants to do the opposite.</p>
<p>The company intends to expand to 10 new markets in the coming year, and has already grown organically through realtor referrals to expand to Asheville and Cary, North Carolina.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google this morning <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/learn-and-do-more-lens-google-images/">announced</a> it&#8217;s bringing its A.I.-powered Lens technology to Google Image Search. The idea, explains the company, is to allow web searchers to learn more about what&#8217;s in a photo &#8211; including, in particular, items they may want to shop for and buy. For example, a photo of a well-decorated living room might have a sofa you like, but the photo itself wouldn&#8217;t have necessarily informed you who made the sofa or where it was for sale.</p>
<p>Google Lens &#8211; yes, acting very much like Pinterest &#8211; will now be able to help with that.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be able to tap on &#8220;dots&#8221; that appear within the photo, which designate items Google Lens has identified, or you can use your finger to &#8220;draw&#8221; around an object in the photo to trigger Google Images to search for related information. Google then searches across the web, including for other images, web pages, and even videos where this object may appear.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just for shopping, of course. Google Lens can also be used to learn more about landmarks, animals, places you want to travel and more.</p>
<p><img class="vertical alignnone size-large wp-image-1737367" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Lens-Sofa.gif?w=339" alt="" width="339" height="680" /></p>
<p>But Google naturally sees a good fit for Lens when it comes to directing users to products and, therefore, the websites of potential Google advertisers. This is the area where Pinterest has been steadily advancing.</p>
<p>Pinterest last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/10/pinterest-reports-25-increase-in-monthly-active-users/">reported a 25 percent increase in monthly active users</a>, as it gears up for its IPO. That means more people are starting their shopping journeys on its site, looking for purchase inspiration around things like fashion, home décor, travel, and other ideas. It&#8217;s also been beefing up its advertising product to further capture users&#8217; interests and connect them with brands, having earlier this year added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/31/pinterest-gives-advertisers-a-way-to-show-promoted-videos-that-take-up-the-screen/">promoted videos to its ad products. </a></p>
<p>And just a week ago, Pinterest announced it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/pinterest-is-turning-more-of-its-window-shoppers-into-buyers-with-newest-features/">rebuilt the infrastructure around product pins</a> to make its site and app more &#8220;shoppable,&#8221; while reporting that tests of the changes had shown a 40 percent increase in visits to retailers&#8217; site, as a result.</p>
<p>For these reasons &#8211; not to mention the looming threat of Facebook and Instagram ads sending users directly to retailers&#8217; websites, and <a href="https://www.axios.com/amazon-becoming-3rd-biggest-digital-ad-platform-37338b9c-54f5-42cd-b081-79698e89f559.html">Amazon&#8217;s not insignificant entry</a> into the advertising business &#8211; it&#8217;s clear that it was time for Google to leverage its own technology to help improve shopping and click-through rates for retailers on its site, as well.</p>
<p>Google says Lens in Images is now live on the mobile web for people in the U.S. searching in English, and will soon be rolled out to other countries, languages and Google Images locations.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/founders-fund" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="founders-fund">Founders Fund <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has led the $6 million Series A for <a href="https://www.summersalt.com/">Summersalt</a>, an early-stage e-commerce startup embracing the next-gen consumer&#8217;s penchant for inclusivity and affordability.</p>
<p>Headquartered in St. Louis, the 1-year old company sells swimsuits designed in-house with eco-friendly fabrics directly to consumers. Like other D2C brands, Summersalt cuts out the middlemen to give its customers access to its swimsuits for $95 or less. What sets it apart is its data-focused fit system. With a patent on recommending garments based on body type and consumer preference, it uses more than 10,000 scans of real women&#8217;s bodies and some 1.5 million measurements to create what it says are designer-quality garments.</p>
<p>Co-founder and chief executive officer Lori Coulter designs all the swimsuits herself and sources the fabrics directly with factories in the U.S. and Asia. With the latest investment, Coulter says the company will launch a line of travel wear and expand its inventory to offer more sizes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A core value of the brand really is inclusivity and we know from an economic perspective that by moving up to size 22, we really can acquire a broader set of consumers,&#8221; Coulter told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><img class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1737156" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/6.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="667" /><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reshmachattaram/">Reshma Chattaram Chamberlin</a>, co-founder and chief brand officer, said their strategy is to cater to women like them. Chamberlin herself is an immigrant, originally from Mumbai, while Coulter, a mother of two, was born and raised in Missouri.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We were both tired of seeing the oversexualized approach to swimwear,&#8221; Chamberlain told TechCrunch. &#8220;We wanted a brand to appeal to women like us so we could feel sexy on our own terms. We wanted to appeal to women across the country, whether that&#8217;s a mom in Missouri or a stylish girl in Brooklyn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Women like us are immigrants. Women like us are moms. Women like us are size 2 and women like us are size 22,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>The pair said the move to incorporate a travel line is in keeping with their wanderlust-themed brand, which appeals to younger consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a unique time in retail; women prefer experiences over things,&#8221; Coulter said. &#8220;We really see this as the next frontier in retail. We want to position Summersalt as the next-generation brand focused around travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/peter-thiel" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="peter-thiel">Peter Thiel <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-owned Founders Fund&#8217;s first investment in the startup, which previously raised <span style="font-weight: 400;">a <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/mergers-acquisitions/swimwear-start-up-summersalt-raises-2-million-seed-round-1202644521/">$2 million</a> seed round in March 2018. </span>Lewis and Clark Ventures, Revolution’s Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, Dundee Venture Capital, Breakout Capital, Cultivation Capital, Victress Capital, Amplifyher Ventures, M25 and Giuliana and Bill Rancic also participated in the funding.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/european-parliament" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="european-parliament">European Parliament <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has called for a full audit of Facebook following a string of data breach scandals &#8212;  including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cambridge-analytica/">Cambridge Analytica affair</a>.</p>
<p>MEPs are urging the company to allow <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/european-union" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="european-union">European Union <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> bodies to carry out a full audit to assess data protection and security of users’ personal data, following the scandal in which the data of 87 million Facebook users was improperly obtained and misused.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20181018IPR16525/facebook-cambridge-analytica-meps-demand-action-to-protect-citizens-privacy">resolution</a>, adopted today, they have also recommended Facebook make additional changes to combat election interference &#8212; asserting the company has not just breached the trust of European users &#8220;but indeed EU law&#8221;.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the company for comment on the parliament&#8217;s resolution.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/11/audit-facebook-and-overhaul-competition-law-say-meps-responding-to-breach-scandals/">Earlier this month</a> the EU parliament&#8217;s civil liberties committee adopted a similar resolution, calling for a full and independent audit of Facebook and for the company to make further changes to its platform.</p>
<p>The Libe committee also called for an update to EU competition rules to reflect what it dubs “the digital reality”, and investigation of what it called the “possible monopoly” of big tech social media platforms.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement today, following the parliament&#8217;s vote, civil liberties committee chair Claude Moraes said: “This is a global issue, which has already affected our referenda and our elections. This resolution sets out the measures that are needed, including an independent audit of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> an update to our competition rules, and additional measures to protect our elections. Action must be taken now, not just to restore trust in online platforms, but to protect citizens’ privacy and restore trust and confidence in our democratic systems.”</p>
<p>The resolution follows an appearance by Facebook&#8217;s founder <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="mark-zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in front of the EU parliament&#8217;s Conference of Presidents in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/22/zuckerberg-didnt-make-any-friends-in-europe-today/">May</a>, and a series of parliament committee hearings including with Facebook staffers.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s tough new data protection framework, GDPR, only came into force this May &#8212; so the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cambridge-analytica" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cambridge-analytica">Cambridge Analytica <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> breach is being handled under the bloc&#8217;s prior data protection framework, comprising a patchwork of Member State laws.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/uk-watchdog-hands-facebook-500k-fine/">earlier today</a> a fine handed to Facebook for this breach by the UK data watchdog was upheld. The £500k penalty is the maximum possible fine under the country&#8217;s prior data protection regime.</p>
<p>In the new resolution, MEPs have suggested the data obtained by Cambridge Analytica may have been used for political purposes, by both sides in the UK referendum on membership of the EU and to target voters during the 2016 US presidential election &#8212; describing it as a matter of urgency that electoral laws be adapted to take account of digital campaigning. (Clearly with an eye on the upcoming EU elections, next May.)</p>
<p>To combat electoral meddling via social media, MEPs are proposing:</p>
<ul>
<li>applying conventional “off-line” electoral safeguards online: rules on spending transparency and limits, respect for silence periods and equal treatment of candidates;</li>
<li>making it easy to recognise online political paid advertisements and the organisation behind them;</li>
<li>banning profiling for electoral purposes, including use of online behaviour that may reveal political preferences;</li>
<li>that social media platforms should label content shared by bots, speed up the process of removing fake accounts and work with independent fact-checkers and academia to tackle disinformation;</li>
<li>investigations should be carried out by member states with the support of Eurojust, into alleged misuse of the online political space by foreign forces.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the UK a parliamentary committee also recently urged the government to prioritize updating electoral law to take account of digital risks to democratic processes. Although the government has so far only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/fake-news-threat-to-democracy-gets-back-burner-response-from-uk-govt/">taken a cautious approach</a>, saying it&#8217;s still gathering evidence via a series of reviews into different aspects of the issue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Facebook has been rolling out its own system of checks on political advertisers in certain regions &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/facebook-rolls-out-checks-for-uk-political-ads/">the UK</a>.  Though MEPs evidently believe the company needs to go further.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s DPA also previously called for an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/11/facebook-under-fresh-political-pressure-as-uk-watchdog-calls-for-ethical-pause-of-ad-ops/">ethical pause on political microtargeting via online platforms</a>, saying it had a number of concerns about how data is being used and potentially misused.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/xiaomi" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="xiaomi">Xiaomi <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has <a href="http://blog.mi.com/en/2018/10/25/news-technology-meets-art-xiaomi-launches-flagship-mi-mix-3-at-the-forbidden-city/">announced</a> the newest version of its bezel-less Mi Mix family, and it doesn&#8217;t sport a notch like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/31/xiaomis-mi-8-may-be-its-most-brazen-iphone-copycat-yet/">its Mi 8 flagship.</a> Indeed, unlike the Mi 8 &#8212; which I called one of Xiaomi&#8217;s most brazen Apple clones &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot more to get excited about.</p>
<p>The Mi Mix 3 was unveiled at an event in Beijing and, like its predecessor, Xiaomi boasts that it offers a full front screen. Rather than opting for the near-industry standard notch, Xiaomi has developed a slider that houses its front-facing camera. Vivo and Oppo have done similar using a motorized approach, but Xiaomi&#8217;s is magnetic while it can also be programmed for functions such as answering calls.</p>
<p>That array gives it a claimed 93.4 percent screen-to-body ratio and a full 6.4-inch 1080p AMOLED display. The slider, by the way, is good for 300,000 cycles, according to Xiaomi&#8217;s lab testing.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1737346" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mi-mix-3-side.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="366" /></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/xiaomi-unveils-concept-phone-with-near-bezel-less-display/">The device itself follows the much-lauded Mi Mix aesthetic</a> with a Snapdragon 845 processor and up to 10GB in RAM (!) in the highest-end model. Xiaomi puts plenty of emphasis on cameras. The Mi Mix 3 includes four of them: a 24-megapixel front camera paired with a two-megapixel sensor and on the back, like the Mi 8, a dual camera array with two 12-megapixel cameras.</p>
<p>Xiaomi has also snuck an &#8216;AI button&#8217; on the left side of the phone, a first for the company. That awakens its Xiao Ai voice assistant, but since it only supports Chinese don&#8217;t expect to see that on worldwide models.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1737344" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mi-mix-3-2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="363" /></p>
<p>The 10GB version &#8212; made in partnership with Palace Museum, located at the Forbidden City where the device was launched &#8212; also packs 256GB of onboard storage and is priced at RMB 4,999, or $720. That&#8217;s in addition to a ceramic design that Xiaomi says is inspired by the museum&#8230; better that than a fruity-sounding U.S. company.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the special model, and the more affordable options include 6GB + 128GB for RMB 3,299 ($475), 8GB +128G for RMB 3,599 ($520) and 8GB + 256GB for RMB 3,999 ($575). The company also plans to introduce a 5G version in Europe sometime early next year.</p>
<p>Xiaomi said the phones will go on sale in China from 1 November, there&#8217;s no word on international availability or pricing right now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/27/safe-as-houses-compass-400m-real-estate-unicorn/">raising $400 million</a> in September in a round that valued it at $4.4 billion, the real estate startup <a href="http://compass.com">Compass</a> is making an acquisition to help it double down on growth: it is acquiring a portion of <a href="https://www.shopspring.com/">Spring</a>, the mobile-first fashion shopping app that has raised more than $100 million since 2014, to work on parts of Compass&#8217;s AI-based <span style="font-family: Arial;">real estate platform, which provides a marketplace to post properties for sale and rental across the US and soon other countries.</span></p>
<p>Compass and Spring are not disclosing the financial terms of this deal. When Spring last raised money in May 2017 &#8212; $65 million led by Fidelity &#8212; it was valued at nearly $152 million, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/64789-66/company/profile">PitchBook</a>.</p>
<p>Compass is just one of Spring&#8217;s buyers. It is taking on an undisclosed element of the business (enough that Compass was clear to describe this a &#8216;strategic acquisition&#8217;), and key staff including Spring CTO Satwik Seshasai, director of engineering <span style="font-family: Arial;">Jim Grandpre, </span>and some 20 others from its engineering team. But at the same time, we have learned that the other part of Spring will be going to another buyer, <a href="http://shoprunner.com">Shoprunner</a>, the Alibaba-backed shopping app that has ambitions to take on Amazon.</p>
<p>It seems that there was an overlap of technical people between the two e-commerce companies, so that is part of the reason why the company was split up in the acquisition process. TechCrunch&#8217;s Kate Clark has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/can-shoprunner-compete-with-amazon-sam-yagan-wants-to-find-out/">more</a> on ShopRunner&#8217;s latest fundraise and acquisition of Spring.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/can-shoprunner-compete-with-amazon-sam-yagan-wants-to-find-out/embed/#?secret=rIlGlYUGvj" data-secret="rIlGlYUGvj" width="800" height="450" title="&#8220;Confirmed: ShopRunner acquires Spring, raises $40M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: Arial;">“Spring was founded on the belief that consumers were looking for a better online shopping experience, a single destination where they could find all their favorite brands,” said Seshasai in a statement. “In a similar way, Compass is embracing the digital future and revolutionizing a legacy industry with agent satisfaction at its focus. I am thrilled to help Compass grow its technology platform as it continues to be a leading disruptor in the real estate industry.”</span></p>
<p>Seshasai will become Compass&#8217;s senior director of growth infrastructure, and Compass said that the team it&#8217;s acquiring will be deployed alongside Compass&#8217;s existing team of engineers and other areas of the business &#8220;<span style="font-family: Arial;">to help accelerate its technology roadmap and develop technologies that enhance the agent experience.&#8221; They will work under and with Compass&#8217;s VP of engineering, Priyendra Deshwal, and head of product, Eytan Seidman, and an existing team of 120+ technical staff.<br class="m_-82354956182267209kix-line-break" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Compass has built itself to become a very slick site focussing on high-end properties and customers, but under the surface it is a well-oiled tech beast. It was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/16/urban-compass/">co-founded</a> by ex-banker Robert Reffkin and Ori Allon, and Allon is an engineering whiz who had built and sold search businesses to Google and then Twitter (respectively helping each of them build foundational search algorithms). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">“The team at Spring built a service-oriented brand and technology platform that attracted 2,000 of today’s top retailers,” said Ori Allon, Compass Founder, and Executive Chairman, in a statement. “At Compass, we believe in investing in top talent which is why we welcome the opportunity to bring members of the Spring team on board. Our new Compass colleagues will execute against and innovate on ways to build the end-to-end real estate platform with real-time insights and technologies that will redefine the industry.”</span></p>
<p>When Spring first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/14/spring-david-tischs-latest-venture-is-instagram-for-shopping/">sprouted up in 2014</a> &#8212; co-founded by brothers Alan and David Tisch &#8212; many thought its mobile-only approach would help it steal a march on the world of online fashion. It&#8217;s aim was clear: to provide a marketplace for labels and shops that finally made buying and checking out from the virtual store as easy as swiping right. Indeed, we described it at the time as the &#8220;Instagram of shopping.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, over time it appeared to <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/spiral-springs-great-mobile-experiment/">expand what it was doing in an effort to scale</a> &#8212; adding a web site and working with retailers as well &#8212; which diluted its pitch to brands that had hoped for a more direct relationship with consumers. And on top of that, you could argue that Instagram itself has taken on the task of becoming the &#8220;Instagram of shopping.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Shoprunner part of the Spring deal has been rumored for the last month. A report in <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/10/5/17939860/shoprunner-spring-acquisition-michael-rubin-david-tisch">Recode</a> that broke the news seemed to imply that Spring had failed to be able to scale its business, despite its funding and the expansion of its business.</p>
<p>There has been an ongoing consolidation trend in e-commerce: a plethora of interesting looking startups have emerged over the year years that have found raising early money easy enough in the current climate, but have found the challenge of scaling (and the money that requires) to be hard, if not impossible. That has led to many of them either disappearing quietly, or retreating into a quiet but less fast-paced growth, or getting gobbled up.</p>
<p>Compass&#8217;s acquisition is another kind of interesting outcome. Finding good talent and assembling a team that has proven to be able to work together can be some of the biggest (and costliest) scaling challenges at startups, and tapping into that pool of startups that might otherwise be going out the door is one way to address that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> came in ahead of <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR/analysis?p=TWTR">analysts&#8217; financial estimates</a> in its third quarter, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000156459018025008/twtr-ex992_6.htm">reporting</a> $758 million in revenue (a 29 percent year-over-year increase) and earnings per share of 21 cents.</p>
<p>Analysts had <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR/analysis?p=TWTR">predicted</a> revenue of $703 million and EPS of 14 cents per share. Ad revenue was also up 29 percent, to $650 million, and Twitter says total ad engagements increased 50 percent year over year.</p>
<p>However, user growth didn&#8217;t quite match expectations, with 326 monthly active users, lower than <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/25/twitter-q3-2018-earnings.html">predictions</a> of 330 million, and also a decline from the same period last year, when Twitter had 335 million MAUs.</p>
<p>In the earnings release, the company says its user growth was &#8220;impacted by a number of factors including: GDPR, decisions we have made to prioritize the health of the platform and not move to paid SMS carrier relationships in certain markets, as well as a product change that reduced automated usage and a technical issue that temporarily reduced the number of notifications sent.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1737341" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/twitter-mau.png?w=550" alt="Twitter MAU" width="550" height="624" /></p>
<p>In a statement, CEO Jack Dorsey similarly suggested that the company has been focusing on the &#8220;health&#8221; of the community, rather than pursuing growth at all costs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re achieving meaningful progress in our efforts to make Twitter a healthier and valuable everyday service,&#8221; Dorsey said. “We’re doing a better job detecting and removing spammy and suspicious accounts at sign-up. We&#8217;re also continuing to introduce improvements that make it easier for people to follow events, topics and interests on Twitter, like adding support for U.S. TV shows in our new event infrastructure. This quarter’s strong results prove we can prioritize the long-term health of Twitter while growing the number of people who participate in public conversation.”</p>
<p>While Twitter still attracts plenty of criticism for its approach to safety, harassment and misinformation (it was slower than the other major online platforms to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/twitter-says-it-has-removed-several-accounts-affiliated-with-infowars-and-alex-jones/">ban Alex Jones and Infowars</a>, for example), it has taken steps in the past few months to suspend accounts that were &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/27/twitter-suspends-more-accounts-for-engaging-in-coordinated-manipulation/">engaging in coordinated manipulation</a>,&#8221; as well as those who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/14/twitter-is-purging-accounts-that-were-trying-to-evade-prior-suspensions/">tried to get around previous suspensions</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> continues to increase its efforts in Southeast Asia&#8217;s fast-growing market after it picked Thailand as the location for its second Apple Store in the region.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/th/retail/iconsiam/">A post on Apple&#8217;s website reveals</a> that it will operate a retail store at the soon-to-open Iconsiam which is set to become Bangkok&#8217;s largest mall when it opens next month. The Apple Store is set to open its doors on November 10. An Apple representative confirmed to TechCrunch that the details on the website are indeed accurate.</p>
<p>The new store follows the opening of an Apple Store in Singapore last year, which marked the U.S. firm&#8217;s first official brick and mortar presence in Southeast Asia, a region of 650 million consumers that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/12/google-southeast-asias-internet-economy-is-growing-faster-than-expected/">has more internet users than the U.S. population</a>.</p>
<p>Apple doesn&#8217;t break out sales figures for Southeast Asia. The region is part of the &#8216;rest of Asia Pacific&#8217; bracket which excludes Japan and China and accounts for around six percent of Apple&#8217;s global revenue.</p>
<p>That is a drop in the proverbial ocean for Apple, but Southeast Asia is one of the few parts of the world where smartphone sales continue to grow at a double-digit percentage. With its devices accounting for a minor share of the region&#8217;s markets, primarily due to pricing and a lack of carrier subsidies, it makes sense that Apple is stepping up its retail focus.</p>
<div id="attachment_1737331" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1737331" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PastedGraphic-4.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Iconsiam mall which will house Bangkok&#8217;s first Apple Store is still under construction but scheduled to open next month</p></div>
<p>Apple&#8217;s official presence in Asia had been limited to China, Hong Kong and Japan until recent times when it opened stores in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/02/first-apple-store-taiwan/">Korea, Taiwan and Singapore</a>. TechCrunch understands from sources within the real estate industry that Apple is considering Indonesian capital Jakarta and Vietnam as its next store launch markets in Southeast Asia. It intended to open the Thai store as soon as last year but struggled to find a location that it deemed to be fitting for its store, we understand.</p>
<p>Right now, most countries in Southeast Asia are served by &#8216;licensed&#8217; Apple stores from third-parties, unofficial retailers, Alibaba-owned e-commerce service Lazada and Apple&#8217;s own online store. Outside of the region, it has long tried to bring its iconic stores to India, but regulations on operating physical stores have hampered its progress.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been nearly a decade since Rockstar Games introduced Red Dead Redemption, a massive open world game with a story about as reflective of American culture as the Grand Theft Auto franchise.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, Red Dead Redemption II goes live after months of breathless speculation. And yes, it&#8217;s as good as you dreamed it. That&#8217;s not to say that the layers of interactivity, which are a huge step forward for the next generation of open world games, are not without their faults. But the level of attention to detail, the way that the various components of the game work in conjunction, and the intricacy of even the most mundane activities makes playing Red Dead Redemption 2 feel as authentic as being Arthur Morgan yourself.</p>
<p>But before we dive into the review, it&#8217;s worth noting that Devin and I each spent less than a dozen hours playing this game before sitting down to write. In fact, according to the progress bar in my game, I&#8217;m less than 20 percent of the way through the story, with even less completed of the challenges and the Compendium (index of items discovered/found). This game is so massive, it would be impossible to bring you thoughtful analysis of the story. We haven&#8217;t finished it yet.</p>
<p>We do, however, have some early impressions of the game below. For those looking to avoid spoilers, don&#8217;t worry — everything we talk about takes place in the first couple hours of the game and we&#8217;ve shied away from naming places, characters, and missions.</p>
<h2>A world of details</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Red-Dead-Redemption-2_20181023150658.jpg"><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1737202" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Red-Dead-Redemption-2_20181023150658.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a></p>
<p>For a game this big, it kind of makes sense to start with the details. It&#8217;s evident that this is an environment not just crafted with care, but presented with directorial intent. That&#8217;s important to say right off the bat — this isn&#8217;t just a big chunk of land for you to wander, but the stage for a story, and a stage that has been dressed with more care than perhaps any game to date.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to talk about square mileage, about how many buildings can be entered, about the hours of dialogue you may encounter. But those are quantitative measures when what matter are the qualitative ones.</p>
<p>The details are what set RDR2 apart. Everywhere you look there are details, from the seams and rips on the dozens of coats you&#8217;ll see and wear, to the fact that you have to clean and oil your gun regularly, to how the items you buy are actually on the walls of the general store you visit. The dialogue too is remarkably consistent and well acted, and largely free from anachronism while retaining personality and a sense of humor.</p>
<div id="attachment_1737192" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Red-Dead-Redemption-2_20181023114215.jpg"><img class="breakout size-full wp-image-1737192" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Red-Dead-Redemption-2_20181023114215.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Look at that SNOW.</p></div>
<p>Although it&#8217;s difficult to forget that you&#8217;re playing a game, these details make it very easy to fool yourself that the world in which you’re playing is a real place. Nearly everything you do, and how you do it, retains the conceit of the Old West.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t even begin to wonder how much work it took to put this together. I had similar thoughts when I was playing Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Odyssey, but while the scale and visual grandeur of that game impressed me, RDR2 hits those same notes while also hitting home in the much more difficult areas of authenticity, believability, and consistent direction.</p>
<h2>From RDR to L2</h2>
<p>One of the loveliest characteristics of RDR2 is how reminiscent it is of the original Red Dead. Riding my horse along a beaten path, normally near a railway, takes me back to 2010. All the things players have done before — shooting, riding, walking through the world — feel similar to the last game, albeit slightly smoother. The cinematic camera (a page out of the GTA playbook) is particularly delightful, especially in autopilot alongside NPCs leading the way.</p>
<p><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1737261" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RD2CinematicCamera.gif" alt="" width="801" height="451" /></p>
<p>The world itself is far more alive and full of detail, and this time around, there is something deeper behind each item, NPC, and animal in the game. Red Dead Redemption taught us that our left trigger button was about aim, and aim only. In the next iteration of the game, L2 opens the door to everything else that this immersive world has to offer.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Red-Dead-Redemption-2_20181024180753.jpg"><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1737222" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Red-Dead-Redemption-2_20181024180753.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a></p>
<p>And it’s this untethering of every single object and character in the game that pushes RDR2 steps toward reality, and leaps forward for gaming.</p>
<p>During Story missions, Arthur can use L2 to make real-time decisions about how to ambush a camp. If he focuses on an item on a shelf in the store, the player can open up a menu through L2 to buy or inspect that item. Focus on an NPC walking around camp, and L2 opens up the options to greet or antagonize them. Approach Arthur’s horse, and L2 opens up a larger menu to feed the horse, brush the horse, or pat the horse. But these aren&#8217;t just empty actions. Feeding and cleaning the horse fill her health and stamina cores, and patting the horse increases her bond with Arthur, all of which affect the quality of the horse as a tool.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that, if Arthur gun is equipped, L2 defaults to aiming down sights, which sure can frighten a horse or an innocent NPC.</p>
<p>Like a crow bar, L2 cracked open the whole world of Red Dead Redemption. If you can inspect a letter on a nightstand, flip it over and read the back, and put it down again, what should stop you from inspecting a live animal to see if it&#8217;s worth hunting. L2 brings up information about the animal like its name, its quality, and what you can get from it.</p>
<h2>Intuitive until it isn’t</h2>
<div id="attachment_1737208" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Red-Dead-Redemption-2_20181024153748.jpg"><img class="breakout size-full wp-image-1737208" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Red-Dead-Redemption-2_20181024153748.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You can look up from a treasure map (handy) but have to dig through menus to pull it out in the first place.</p></div>
<p>Not all of the game&#8217;s interfaces are so fluid and convenient. Trotting along through town in my horse, I tap L2 to see if I can sketch a bird flying by, or study a farm dog, or hail a passerby (&#8220;hey, pardner!&#8221;). But then I see my horse is tired and I want to feed it an apple.</p>
<p>To do this I have to hold L1 to open the radial menu, then simultaneously hit R1 twice to get to the horse menu. Then I hold the right stick down in the direction of the item category I want to use, then (while holding L1 and the stick direction) pull the right and left triggers to find the item I want, and let go of L1 (but still hold the stick!) to use it (X and other normal &#8220;OK&#8221; buttons don&#8217;t do it). Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Meanwhile time continues to pass in the background, albeit slowly, so you&#8217;re doing all this under pressure. Hell, someone might even be shooting at you and you&#8217;re trying to quaff a health tonic before returning to the weapon menu to pull out the rifle from your horse storage before you get gunned down.</p>
<p>It seems to me that although much of the world and your interactions with it are smoothed and interpreted from context, whenever that wasn&#8217;t possible the developers crammed it into this overworked radial menu system. I’ve gotten more used to it as I’ve played, but it still feels like something that started simple and quickly lost its elegance as it turned into a catch-all bucket for &#8220;video game stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Red-Dead-Redemption-2_20181023170315.jpg"><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1737204" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Red-Dead-Redemption-2_20181023170315.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a></p>
<p>There are also systems that are inadequately explained even when there&#8217;s opportunity for it. An early mission has you traveling with one of your bandit companions to hunt a big bear he saw a day&#8217;s ride away.</p>
<p>I happened to succeed in killing the bear, and loaded my &#8216;legendary bear pelt&#8217; on the back of my horse. What was I supposed to do with it? Make a rug? I&#8217;d heard a little about pelts but precious little. Then I saw on my map that there was a trapper nearby — surely he would provide the tutorial I needed! But although the item&#8217;s description specifically said a trapper could turn it into a talisman, the trapper seemed to be able to do no such thing</p>
<p>Did I need to park my horse closer and hail him with it nearby? Did I &#8220;have&#8221; the pelt, or did it need to be there? Did I need to sell it to him first? Did I have to craft something on my own? Did I need to talk to my mission guy, or the cook who handles pelts in the camp? I had no clue and the game gave me no indication either. I couldn&#8217;t just keep it, since it took up valuable space on my horse — I had to turn down giving a lady a ride home because I&#8217;d have had to leave the pelt behind.</p>
<p>Ultimately I brought it back to camp, but couldn&#8217;t make anything out of it there either. Carts and boxes were everywhere but I couldn&#8217;t store the pelt in any of them. I dropped it on the ground and found myself and it teleported to the edge of camp; a message told me that &#8220;items dropped in camp will appear in a convenient place&#8221; or something. Oh, so the whole camp is a storage area! Nope. As soon as I rode away I was told I&#8217;d &#8220;abandoned&#8221; the pelt and some of its parts would go to the nearest trapper. What?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t envy the developers and the info dumps they have to place like mines throughout this enormous world and story, but it felt like this was just one stumble after another, with relatively core gameplay elements that were almost completely unexplained. It&#8217;s an unexpected and forgivable failure given how much goes right, but the contrast is all the more jarring when it happens.</p>
<h2>Nothing mundane about it</h2>
<div id="attachment_1737245" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="breakout size-full wp-image-1737245" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Red-Dead-Redemption-2_20181024195317.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Eating stew with a beautiful view</p></div>
<p>RDR2 sets the bar high in a number of ways, but the overarching achievement is how closely this game tries to mimic reality. In some ways, this opens the world up, and in others, it limits you.</p>
<p>Arthur can&#8217;t carry around seven guns at once, so his horse stores the guns he can&#8217;t carry. If he forgets to equip his guns before running into a shootout on foot, he&#8217;s probably in trouble. Likewise, if Arthur goes hunting and loads a bear skin on the back of his horse, there isn&#8217;t any room to bring back a bounty target.</p>
<p>But Arthur isn&#8217;t just hunting for sport, or even for food. Whereas the last Red Dead focused on hunting as a way to make money, eat, or simply collect animals in the index, hunting now comes with its own system similar to Dead Eye and is paired together with crafting (which I&#8217;ll get to shortly).</p>
<p><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1737262" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RD2Tracking.gif" alt="" width="801" height="451" /></p>
<p>The hunting system is called Eagle Eye, and it&#8217;s slightly reminiscent of the Instinct mode in Hitman. This system lets Arthur track animal trails, paw prints, animal dung, etc. to find his desired prey. Clicking L3 and R3 simultaneously activates Eagle Eye, and then pressing R1 lets you follow the track without remaining in the slow-mo world of Eagle Eye.</p>
<p>Tracking doesn&#8217;t work so well for aquatic animals like fish and alligators, but fishing is an easy, laid-back way to gather food or turn a small profit.</p>
<p>Inspecting animals, via L2, ensures Arthur is targeting the right size and quality of animal, and the method by which Arthur hunts affects the quality of the skins. This seems unimportant, but in the exotic world of crafting, you might find yourself caring a lot.</p>
<p>Crafting allows Arthur or other NPCs (like the Trapper, or the camp cook Pearson) to create new items from stuff they&#8217;ve gathered in the wilderness. That could mean mixing up some meat with an herb to create a specific dish, which would have its own specific effect on health and stamina, or bringing back a few pelts to have more comfortable and colorful accommodations around camp.</p>
<p>Again, this method of hunting and crafting is more in line with how an outlaw might actually live off of the land in 1899. And in adding Eagle Eye and the ability to craft, the more mundane parts of Red Dead Redemption have come alive. In the last game, hunting was something you stumbled upon. The most interactive piece of it was buying and setting bait. In RDR2, hunting big game like bears and buffalo is nearly as enjoyable an activity as the story missions.</p>
<h2>Stone cold or heart of gold?</h2>
<p>The honor system from Red Dead Redemption is alive and well in RDR2, but with some added flare. Because the game tries to mimic real life, with all its opportunities and limitations, the honor system is even more consequential now.</p>
<p>Deeper interactivity through L2 allows you to interact with almost every NPC, even those that aren’t involved in challenges or side missions or story missions. What’s more, those NPCs remember you.</p>
<p>In one instance, a man had been bit by a snake and was screaming out nearby a road. I stopped to help him, sucked the poison out, and went on my way. Later, when I rode into town, he was sitting on a bench outside the gunsmith and he called out to me. He said thanks and offered to pay for any gun I’d like to buy inside the gunsmith. My decision to save him, instead of killing him and looting his body, not only gave me honor points but resulted in a reward.</p>
<p>In another instance, I accidentally pulled out my knife when I got in a bar fight. Instead of innocently beating a dude up, I killed him. The townspeople mentioned the murder the next time I came into town, and the only way to get rid of the bounty on my head was to pay it off at the Post Office.</p>
<p>These decisions and their respective results are pretty straight forward. More nuanced, however, is the effect that Arthur’s honor has on the atmosphere of the game. Honor level changes the way that the story plays out, affects the kill cams, alters the music in the game, and changes the way Arthur dreams and writes in his journal.</p>
<p>In the short time we’ve been able to play the game, it’s hard to tell how extremely this affects the game. I did notice, however, when my honor was at its highest level that one of the shootouts was accompanied by up-tempo (almost celebratory) banjo music, and that kill cams had a goldish tint to them. It’s unclear if that was directly related to my honor or not, but it felt like a subtle dynamic change.</p>
<p>This game offers no shortage of customization options, from your horse to your gun to your clothes to your camp. But there is perhaps no more influential factor that separates one player’s experience of the game from another than Honor.</p>
<h2>Dear diary</h2>
<p>I want to give an especial callout to the detail lavished on the catalogs and books in the game, as well as Arthur&#8217;s journal. The tongue-in-cheek period-style descriptions of equipment and clothing items sometimes run to multiple paragraphs, and as there&#8217;s no particular hurry for much of the game, why not take the time to read them?</p>
<p>Arthur&#8217;s journal is a treat as well. Although it is in some ways just a way to recap the story for you, it&#8217;s a pleasure to read the hand-written entries and the main character&#8217;s thoughts on events as they played out; missions will be described differently depending on how they ended or choices you made. And meanwhile every place you visit, and every critter you &#8220;study&#8221; will be sketched in the book in the order you see them.</p>
[gallery ids="1737189,1737190,1737207,1737201"]
<p>This isn&#8217;t explained or anything, and I was tickled when I figured it out. I had made a long trek back from a mission and stopped by a few places, scoped out a squirrel, some chickens, a deer and some other things in passing. When I went to my journal a few game days later, there they all were in order, as if (as is the intent) Arthur had in fact been jotting them down while I wasn&#8217;t looking.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame the journal and books aren&#8217;t more prominently presented — the journal is in your horse&#8217;s pack, or that&#8217;s where it ended up for me. Take the time to read it and anything else you come across; as much effort was put into the writing here as it was everywhere else in the game.</p>
<h2>Not-so-final word</h2>
<p>Needless to say RDR2 gets a hearty recommendation from us despite some nitpicks and even a couple serious cracks in the carefully-constructed facade. It&#8217;s a landmark game in the open world genre and an artistic achievement in its own right. It&#8217;s worth your money.</p>
<p>That said, our limited time with the game, and choice to play it as though we were regular players and not blast through to the end, means we&#8217;re unable to evaluate the entirety of the game. I find it exceedingly unlikely that the game gets worse — if anything, it likely gets better as the story and gameplay concepts progress.</p>
<p>Still, there are a few specifics we should mention that we plan to look at over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Online isn&#8217;t live yet and won&#8217;t be for a while. This isn&#8217;t core to the main game but will surely be a huge draw as the game ages and its quality will affect whether it&#8217;s worth picking up again or recommending to a friend a year or two from now.</p>
<p>The honor system, though we touched on it, is pretty hard to test thoroughly even with two people playing in parallel. We haven&#8217;t been able to experience how the game changes significantly to accommodate your choice of amorality or virtue.</p>
<p>The story is in many ways just beginning, not to mention the side stories of your camp members and other figures you encounter. Did Rockstar frontload all the good acting and setpieces? Does it fizzle out at the end? Doubtful but we can&#8217;t say one way or the other. Once we&#8217;ve both finished the game or gotten far enough to feel confident in our opinions we&#8217;ll issue a followup review and link it here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite share price struggles, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/xiaomi" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="xiaomi">Xiaomi <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has revealed that it is on track for a record sales year which will see it easily surpass its goal of selling 100 million smartphones in 2018.</p>
<p>Wang Xiang, the executive in charge of the Chinese firm&#8217;s international business, said on Twitter that he expects to hit its 2018 100 million sales target by the end of October. That would beat last year&#8217;s 90 million sales and give Xiaomi a further two months to raise the figure higher still. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/22/gartner-reports-first-ever-global-decline-in-smartphone-sales/">Given that phone sales are declining worldwide</a> with many in the industry struggling, that&#8217;s no mean feat.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Xiaomi Corporation expects its shipment of smartphones to exceed 100M units by the end of October, 2018, successfully reaching the full-year target set last September. Xiaomi will reach the target two months ahead of schedule, and it exceeds the unit shipment of 90M in 2017! <a href="https://t.co/VnJk1iLiXr">pic.twitter.com/VnJk1iLiXr</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Wang Xiang (@XiangW_) <a href="https://twitter.com/XiangW_/status/1055373561685192704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Wang didn&#8217;t provide further details on sales, but we already know that most of the company&#8217;s business happens in the Chinese market. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/22/xiaomi-first-quarter/">Xiaomi&#8217;s most recent earnings report</a> (its first as a public company) revealed that just 36 percent of its revenue comes from outside of its home market although that figure is steadily increasing. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/02/xiaomi-officially-files-for-hong-kong-ipo/">According to its IPO prospectus</a>, China represented 72 percent of Xiaomi&#8217;s revenue in 2017 which is up from 87 percent and 94 percent in 2016 and 2015, respectively.</p>
<p>Building on that progress, Xiaomi is putting a major focus on expanding overseas post IPO &#8212; it said it would set aside 30 percent of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/09/xiaomi-hong-kong-ipo/">the $4.7 billion that it raised from its Hong Kong listing</a> for international growth.</p>
<p>To date, India has been its most successful market &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/19/samsung-and-xiaomi-had-record-smartphone-shipments-in-india/">it is consistently ranked as the top/near top vendor</a> &#8212; but the Chinese phone maker has a presence across Southeast Asia and it has ventured into global markets that include the Middle East, Central and South America and &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/07/xiaomi-europe/">most recently</a> &#8212; Europe.</p>
<p>Despite hitting its lofty sales target ahead of time, Xiaomi has struggled to win over investors.</p>
<p>Its IPO valuation of $54 billion was well below its reported target of $100 billion, and the company&#8217;s shares have traded below their initial price for the past month. Xiaomi is set to report earnings next month so we should get more detail on its 100 million sales and overall progress then.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1737317" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-25-16.59.12.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="329" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Xiaomi&#8217;s shares have traded below IPO price since September 21</p></blockquote>
<p>Xiaomi previously had a well-documented struggle when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/14/xiaomi-70-million-sales-in-2015/">it missed its sales goal of 100 million devices in 2015</a>. One hallmark of the company&#8217;s rapid rise earlier in the decade was the crazy growth numbers it regularly boasted about but, after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/11/xiaomi-2016-to-2017/">CEO Lei Jun admitted it had grown too fast</a>, it stopped speaking so publicly about its targets.</p>
<p>As a public company, there is, of course, nowhere to hide in terms of numbers. But Wang&#8217;s decision to speak publicly shows that Xiaomi has got its swagger back, even if the market isn&#8217;t feeling the same way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.K. Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has <a href="https://ico.org.uk/facebook-fine-20181025">confirmed</a> that it has hit Facebook with a maximum £500,000 ($645,000) fine around the way it mishandled user data following the Cambridge Analytica scandal earlier this year.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/10/uks-information-commissioner-will-fine-facebook-the-maximum-500k-over-cambridge-analytica-breach/">ICO announced its intention</a> to hand Facebook the fine back in July and it said today that it had not changed its mind after hearing the social network&#8217;s responses to key questions raised. While £500,000 is a drop in the ocean for the U.S. company, it represents the maximum allowable punishment under UK law, which is the significant part to focus on here.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> provided the following statement to TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are currently reviewing the ICO&#8217;s decision. While we respectfully disagree with some of their findings, we have said before that we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and taken action in 2015. We are grateful that the ICO has acknowledged our full cooperation throughout their investigation, and have also confirmed they have found no evidence to suggest UK Facebook users&#8217; data was in fact shared with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cambridge-analytica" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cambridge-analytica">Cambridge Analytica <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. Now that their investigation is complete, we are hopeful that the ICO will now let us have access to CA servers so that we are able to audit the data they received.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The introduction of GDPR has given the ICO the power to issue fines of up to £17 million ($22 million) or four percent of a company&#8217;s global turnover &#8212; that&#8217;s potentially up to $1.6 billion in Facebook&#8217;s case. Luckily for the U.S. firm, though, that isn&#8217;t possible since this investigation began back in May 2017 following questions around digital influence on the Brexit vote.</p>
<p>In the case of Cambridge Analytica, the ICO found that at least one million UK users were among <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/09/facebook-will-tell-you-today-if-cambridge-analytica-had-access-to-your-data/">the 87 million Facebook users whose private data was harvested</a> by Dr. Aleksandr Kogan and his company Global Science Research (GSR).</p>
<p>While the issue was identified in 2015, GSR and Kogan were not booted from Facebook&#8217;s platform until this year. That led the British organization to conclude that beyond failing to &#8220;make suitable checks on apps and developers using its platform,&#8221; Facebook &#8220;did not do enough to ensure those who continued to hold it had taken adequate and timely remedial action.&#8221; Indeed, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/ban-cambridge-analytica/">CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself has admitted</a> that the decision was a mistake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook failed to sufficiently protect the privacy of its users before, during and after the unlawful processing of this data. A company of its size and expertise should have known better and it should have done better,&#8221; Information Commissioner <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/elizabeth-denham" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="elizabeth-denham">Elizabeth Denham <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We considered these contraventions to be so serious we imposed the maximum penalty under the previous legislation. The fine would inevitably have been significantly higher under the GDPR. One of our main motivations for taking enforcement action is to drive meaningful change in how organizations handle people’s personal data,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Denham is slated to present an update on the investigation to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Select Committee on November 6, but she said work on the topic of digital influence on politics will continue beyond that date.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are still bigger questions to be asked and broader conversations to be had about how technology and democracy interact and whether the legal, ethical and regulatory frameworks we have in place are adequate to protect the principles on which our society is based,&#8221; Denham added.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve contacted Facebook for a response to today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p><em>Note: The original version of this story was updated to correct that the fine is £500,000 not $500,000. In addition, Facebook updated its response with an additional line.</em></p>
