				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like virtually every other major tech company, Microsoft is currently on a mission to bring machine learning to all of its applications. It&#8217;s no surprise then that it&#8217;s also bringing &#8216;AI&#8217; to its highly profitable <a href="https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-ca/">Dynamics 365 CRM</a> products. A year ago, the company <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/stevengu/2017/09/25/introducing-dynamics-365-ai-solutions/">introduced</a> its first Dynamics 365 AI solutions and today it&#8217;s expanding this portfolio with the launch of three new products: Dynamics 365 AI for Sales, Customer Service and Market Insights.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many people, when they talk about CRM, or ERP of old, they referred to them as systems of oppression, they captured data,&#8221; said Alysa Taylor, Microsoft corporate VP for business applications and industry. &#8220;But they didn&#8217;t provide any value back to the end user &#8212; and what that end user really needs is a system of empowerment, not oppression.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that few people love their CRM systems (except for maybe a handful of Dreamforce attendees), but &#8216;system of oppression&#8217; is far from the ideal choice of words here. Yet Taylor is right that early systems often kept data siloed. Unsurprisingly, Microsoft argues that Dynamics 365 does not do that, allowing it to now use all of this data to build machine learning-driven experiences for specific tasks.</p>
<p>Dynamics 365 AI for Sales, unsurprisingly, is meant to help sales teams get deeper insights into their prospects using sentiment analysis. That&#8217;s obviously among the most basic of machine learning applications these days, but AI for Sales also helps these salespeople understand what actions they should take next and which prospects to prioritize. It&#8217;ll also help managers coach their individual sellers on the actions they should take.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Customer Service app focuses on using natural language understanding to understand and predict customer service problems and leverage virtual agents to lower costs. Taylor used this part of the announcement to throw some shade at Microsoft&#8217;s competitor Salesforce. &#8220;Many, many vendors offer this, but they offer it in a way that is very cumbersome for organizations to adopt,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Again, it requires a large services engagement, Salesforce partners with IBM Watson to be able to deliver on this. We are now out of the box.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, Dynamics 365 AI for Market Insights does just what the name implies: it provides teams with data about social sentiment, but this, too, goes a bit deeper. &#8220;This allows organizations to harness the vast amounts of social sentiment, be able to analyze it, and then take action on how to use these insights to increase brand loyalty, as well as understand what newsworthy events will help provide different brand affinities across an organization,&#8221; Taylor said. So the next time you see a company try to gin up some news, maybe it did so based on recommendations from Office 365 AI for Market Insights.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens">Microsoft HoloLens</a> mixed reality glasses have always been interesting technology, but it&#8217;s never been clear how the company would move from novelty device to actual viable business use cases. Today, it made a move toward the latter, announcing a couple of applications designed to put the HoloLens to work in Dynamics 365, giving it a real business purpose.</p>
<p>Dynamics 365 is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/06/microsoft-gives-frenemy-salesforce-a-shove-with-new-dynamics-365-integrated-cloud-platform/">Microsoft&#8217;s one-stop shop for CRM and ERP</a>, where a company can work on some of its key business software functions including field service in an integrated fashion. The company has been looking at for HoloLens to bring computing power to a group of field workers like repair technicians for whom even a tablet would be awkward because they have to work with both hands free.</p>
<p>For these people, having a fully functioning Windows 10 computer you can wear on your face could be a big advantage and that&#8217;s what Microsoft is hoping to provide with HoloLens. The problem was finding use cases where this would make sense. One idea is providing remote assistance for people out in the field to get help from subject experts back at the office, and today the company announced Dynamics 365 Remote Assist.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the worker is wearing a HoloLens either to understand the repair scenario before they go to the site or to get remote help from a subject expert while they are at the site. The expert  can virtually see what the technician is seeing through the HoloLens, and walk them through the repair without leaving the office, even circling parts and providing other annotations in real time.</p>
<div id="attachment_1715266" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1715266 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/RemoteAssist_HeroImage_v03.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Microsoft Remote Assist in action with expert walking the technician through the task. Photo: Microsoft</p></div>
<p>Microsoft is not the first company to create such a solution. ScopeAR <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/for-scopear-the-market-is-finally-catching-up-with-the-technology/">announced RemoteAR</a> 4 months ago, a similar product, but Microsoft has the advantage of building it natively into Windows 10 and all that entails including data integration to update the various repositories with information after the repair is complete.</p>
<p>The other business scenario the company is announcing today is called Dynamics 365 Layout. A designer can create a 3D representation of something like a store or factory layout in CAD software, view the design in 3D in HoloLens, and adjust it in real time before the design goes live. As Microsoft&#8217;s Lorraine Bardeen, who has the cool title of General Manager for Microsoft Mixed Reality says, instead of creating cardboard mockups and adjusting your 3D CAD drawing on your computer as you find issues in your design, you can put on your HoloLens and make adjustments in a virtual representation of the layout and it adjusts the CAD drawing for you as you make changes.</p>
<div id="attachment_1715269" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1715269 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Layout_HeroImage_v02.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Laying out the pieces on a factory floor using Dynamics 365 Layout. Photo: Microsoft</p></div>
<p>Bardeen says the company has worked with customers to find real-world use cases that would save time, effort and money using mixed reality with HoloLens.  They cite companies like Chevron, Ford and ThyssenKrupp Elevators as organizations actively embracing this kind of technology, but it still not clear if HoloLens and mixed reality will become a central component of business in the future. These two solutions GA on October 1st and we will begin the process of finding out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fortnite has taken the world by storm. In fact, the game is so popular that Epic has released versions for PC, Xbox, PS4, iOS, Android and the Nintendo Switch, making the game about as accessible as possible.</p>
<p>The popularity of the game stems from the general popularity of the Battle Royale genre and popular streamers like Ninja, who have made the game so much fun to watch. But it also comes from the fun, and often fleeting, skins, dances and pick axes the game offers in its Item Shop.</p>
<p>On October 5th, folks interested in the Switch can pick up some extra Fortnite swag.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Nintendo is releasing a bundle that will include an exclusive Fortnite skin, glider and pick-axe, as well as an extra 1,000 V-Bucks. To be clear, 1,000 V-bucks is the equivalent of $10 and won&#8217;t get you much from the Item Shop.</p>
<p>Plus, as pointed out by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/18/17874414/switch-fortnite-bundle-price-release-date-exclusive-items">the Verge</a>, Nintendo has offered several different bundles which would allow customers to pick up a Switch for $329 alongside one of a few games. In most cases, those games cost money, whereas Fortnite is a free to play game.</p>
<p>But the Nintendo Switch bundle is the only way to get your hands on the Switch gear that comes with it.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time that Epic has given out exclusive gear to players using different hardware or services. There is an exclusive Twitch Prime skin, a Sony PS4 skin, and even a skin for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/09/fornite-for-android-launches-as-a-samsung-galaxy-exclusive-tomorrow/">Galaxy Note 9 owners</a>.</p>
<p>The Bundle is available for $329 on October 5.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 eras weren’t kind to the world’s largest media conglomerates, throwing their business models into question, creating whole new categories of content consumption, and bringing online competition to subscription and ad pricing. Many of the media giants from the 1990s and early 2000s remain market leaders with multi-billion dollar valuations, however, and have become active investors in startups as a tactic to help themselves evolve. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the traditional media companies that have committed to corporate venturing, there are two distinct strategies: those whose investing seems to be about replacing the historic classifieds section of newspapers and diversifying into a range of consumer-facing marketplaces, and those whose investing is concentrated on capturing an early glimpse (and early equity stake) in startups reshaping media.</span></p>
<h2><b>Replacing Classifieds, Investing in Marketplaces</b></h2>
<div id="attachment_1715296" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1715296" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GettyImages-968222952.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mathias Doepfner, CEO of Axel Springer.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the first crisis newspaper groups faced from tech startups in the 1990s and early 2000s was the rise of online classifieds sites (like Craigslist) and transactional marketplaces (like eBay and Amazon), the disruption of their lucrative classified ads revenue stream drove their attention to e-commerce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from Hearst, the major US newspaper and magazine chains &#8211; like Gannett, News Corp, Meredith Corp / Time Inc, and Digital First Media &#8211; haven’t made many investments in startups. Perhaps the financial straits of most US newspaper companies have left little cash for VC investments that won’t pay off for years in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in Northern and Central Europe, where news readership and even print publishing remain healthy by comparison, the leading media groups have been aggressively investing in marketplace and e-commerce startups across the continent over the last decade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Europe’s leading publisher, Axel Springer has made itself an established player in the European startup scene. Axel Springer’s Digital Ventures team has backed marketplaces from Caroobi (for cars) to Airbnb, and their Berlin-based accelerator (run in partnership with Plug &amp; Play) has invested in over 100 young startups, like digital bank N26, boat rental marketplace Zizoo, and influencer-brand marketplace blogfoster. In a move more strategic to its business, the 15,000-employee group made a large investment in augmented reality unicorn Magic Leap this past February as well, forming a partnership to leverage its content IP in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Norway’s Schibsted, Sweden’s Bonnier, and Germany’s Hubert Burda Media (best know to many in tech for their annual DLD conference in Munich) and Holtzbrinck Publishing are each globally active, multi-billion dollar publishers who operate active early- or growth-stage VC portfolios comprised mainly of e-commerce brands and marketplaces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most iconic corporate venture investment by a newspaper conglomerate (or any company for that matter) is without question the $32M check written into 3-year-old Chinese social web startup Tencent in 2001 by the South African publishing group Naspers (founded in 1915). Tencent, now valued around $400B, is Asia’s largest and most powerful digital media company and Naspers’ 31% stake was worth roughly $175B in March 2018 when it sold $10B in shares. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, Naspers has transformed into a holding company that incubates, acquires, and invests in online marketplace businesses around the globe (though it still maintains a relatively small publishing unit).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge for traditional media companies investing in startups beyond the realm of media is that even if wildly successful, those investments neither give them a distinct advantage in media itself nor make their business model like that of a tech company by way of osmosis. These investments can be flashy distractions to make management and shareholders call the company innovative while it fails to actually re-envision its core operations. Investing in Airbnb or BaubleBar doesn’t address the key challenges or opportunities a traditional publishing group faces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore the best case scenario in this strategy seems to be that these companies find enough financial success that they just transition out of the content game and become holding companies for other types of consumer-facing brands the way Naspers has. But even then the path seems uncertain: despite all its other activities, Naspers’ market cap is less than the value of its Tencent shares&#8230;it’s not clear that the best case scenario necessarily transforms the core organization.</span></p>
<h2><b>Investing in the Next Generation of Media</b></h2>
<div id="attachment_1715299" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1715299" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GettyImages-938635050.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="388" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Thomas Rabe, CEO of German media group Bertelsmann. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bertelsmann" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bertelsmann">Bertelsmann <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is unique in treating startup investments as a dedicated division of the conglomerate. (TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP/Getty Images)</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other track for “old media” giants has been to focus on venture capital as a means to uncover the future of the media business so the old guard can learn from the new generation of media entrepreneurs and react to market changes sooner than competitors. Intriguingly, it is consistent that the conglomerates who have taken this strategy are ones whose operations in television, radio, data, and telecom outweigh any involvement in newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bertelsmann, Hearst, and 21st Century Fox have been the most aggressive corporate venture investors in startups working to shape the future of media, whether it be through streaming video services, crowdsourced storytelling platforms, or augmented reality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With annual revenue over €17B, Bertelsmann is one of the largest media companies in the world, spanning television production and broadcasting (RTL Group), book publishing (Penguin Random House), newspapers, magazine publishing (Grüner + Jahr), and education. Unlike of media companies though, it treats venture investments in media startups as a key division of its company rather than as a side project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s core Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments (BDMI) invests across the US and Europe in companies like Audible, Mic, The Athletic, and Wondery (and in funds like Greycroft and SV Angel) but there are also the 3 regionally-focused funds investing in China, India, and Brazil plus the education-focused University Ventures fund it anchors in NYC. Collectively, Bertelsmann teams made 40 new startup investments in 2017 and generated €141M in venture returns, according to their </span><a href="https://www.bertelsmann.com/media/investor-relations/annual-reports/annual-report-2017-financial-information-2.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 Annual Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment arm of Hearst, one of America’s largest publishers with $10.8B in 2017 revenue, has likewise been a major backer of BuzzFeed, Pandora, Hootesuite, and Roku not to mention Chinese language app LingoChamp, live entertainment brand Drone Racing League, VR capture startup 8i, and dozens of other media-related startups. Hearst’s ownership in these ventures makes strategic sense: they provide market insights relevant to the core businesses, offer immediate partnership opportunities, and would be strategic acquisition targets that evolve the company’s position in a changing market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">21st Century Fox and Sky Plc (in which 21st Century Fox owns a 39% stake and is trying to acquire outright) have both made a whole slate of startup investments across the media sector in the last few years. In addition to its $100M investment in live-streaming platform Caffeine (announced on September 5) and similarly massive investment in WndrCo’s NewTV venture led by Meg Whitman, Fox has invested repeatedly in sports-centric OTT service fuboTV, hit newsletter brand TheSkimm, VR studio WITHIN, and fantasy sports app Draftkings with Sky often co-investing or building meaningful stakes in international startups like iflix (a leading streaming video service in Southeast Asia and the Middle East).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since traditional media giants own extensive intellectual property of hit shows, films, and often exclusive rights to popular live events &#8211; not to mention established distribution channels to tens or hundreds of millions of people &#8211; there are immediate partnerships that can be signed to benefit both a startup and the incumbent. The incumbents often re-invest repeatedly to build their ownership and deepen the alignment between the companies, which rarely happens when media companies invest in marketplace startups.</span></p>
<h2><b>Tencent’s always-be-evolving model</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new crop of digital media giants that includes Netflix, Snap, VICE, and BuzzFeed aren’t doing much if any strategic investing. Instead they’re keeping focused on growth of their core product offering. The notable exception is China’s Tencent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to dominating China’s booming messaging app sector with WeChat and QQ, owning 75% market share of music streaming in China, and being the world’s leading games publisher through its own studios (Riot Games, Supercell, etc.) and its minority stakes in Activision Blizzard, Epic Games, and others, Tencent has taken a strategy of investing often and early in promising digital media startups&#8230;and it has its tentacles in everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on Crunchbase data, Tencent has done over 300 investments in startups. It is likely the most active venture investor in China, where most of its portfolio is concentrated, but also backs Western media startups like SoundHound, Wattpad, Spotify, Smule, and Wonder Workshop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tencent can give distribution to these upstarts through its vast portfolio of digital properties and it can keep tabs on what new content formats or business models are gaining traction. It operates from a mindset of perpetually evolving, and trying to snatch up startups whose products could be key assets in the future of content creation, distribution, or monetization. This approach is one both old media giants and the next gen of unicorn media startups should consider. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pace of innovation is moving so fast, and so many new doors are opening up &#8211; from subscription streaming and esports to voice interfaces and augmented reality &#8211; that corporate venture as a core strategy can unlock opportunities for the organization to evolve early, before it ends up being categorized as “old media”.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hulu" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hulu">Hulu&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> live TV streaming service has hit a milestone number of more than 1 million subscribers. That&#8217;s up from the estimated 450,000 <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/22/youtube-live-has-about-300k-subscribers-and-hulus-live-has-450k-sources-reveal.html">CNBC reported</a> at the beginning of the year, and the <a href="https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/hulu-with-live-tv-800000-subscribers-1202825525/">800,000 official number</a> Hulu announced in May. But although the live TV audience may be growing, it&#8217;s still a small fraction of Hulu&#8217;s total subscriber base of 20 million-plus, which includes those who pay for the service&#8217;s on-demand programming.</p>
<p>The new figures were first reported by <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/09/16/hulu-hits-1-million-live-tv-subscriber-mark-debuts-emmy-commercial/1304968002/">USA Today,</a> in a report detailing Hulu&#8217;s Emmy campaign. (The streamer took home <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/2018-emmys-wins-by-program-network-1143213">four Emmys</a> this year &#8211; far behind market leaders, HBO and Netflix, which tied for the top spot with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/2018-emmys-wins-by-program-network-1143213">23 wins</a> apiece, across both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/17/emmy-awards-2018/">last night&#8217;s ceremony</a> and the earlier Creative Arts awards.)</p>
<p>Hulu also confirmed the number&#8217;s accuracy with us.</p>
<p>This one million subscriber milestone is notable given the fierce competition among live TV streaming services these days.</p>
<p>Dish&#8217;s Sling TV and AT&amp;T&#8217;s DirecTV Now still lead the space, thanks to Sling&#8217;s early mover advantage, and DirecTV Now&#8217;s distribution through AT&amp;T&#8217;s wireless business. The former had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dish-network-sling-tv/sling-tv-introduces-a-la-carte-channels-raises-base-package-price-idUSKBN1JO180">2.3 million</a> subscribers as of June, per Reuters, while AT&amp;T said DirecTV Now had <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180724005957/en/ATT-Completes-Time-Warner-Acquisition-Agrees-Acquire">1.8 million</a>, as of its last earnings report in July.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, newcomer YouTube TV hit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/05/30/hulu-live-tv-surpasses-800-000-subscribers/">800,000</a> around May &#8211; a number also <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/youtube-tv-shows-tough-economics-of-skinny-bundles">cited by The Information</a> in July, when reporting the difficulties in making profits in the live TV space. At the time, Hulu with Live TV was said to be &#8220;nearing a million.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sony&#8217;s PlayStation Vue is trailing the lot with <a href="https://digiday.com/media/youtube-tv-and-other-top-streaming-tv-services-benefit-from-having-large-corporate-bosses/">somewhere</a> <a href="https://www.multichannel.com/news/playstation-vue-mobilizes-more-features-418401">over</a> half a million &#8211; no doubt stymied by its branding, which seems to imply its only for PlayStation owners.</p>
<p>And these are just the major players, too.</p>
<p>There are also a growing number of niche streaming services, ranging from the sports-focused <a href="https://www.fubo.tv/">fuboTV</a> to the valued priced cable-like package offered by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/02/philo-and-pandora-are-offering-a-discounted-but-temporary-3-month-bundle-of-tv-and-music/">Philo</a>, which was recently trying to increase distribution through a bundle deal with Pandora. (Hulu has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/29/spotify-expands-its-4-99-per-month-student-bundle-with-hulu-to-include-showtime/">a similar deal</a> with Spotify).</p>
<p>Plus, AT&amp;T quickly capitalized on the Time Warner merger with a second, low-cost service called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/att-launches-a-low-cost-live-tv-streaming-service-watchtv/">WatchTV. </a></p>
<p>While there are now several skinny bundle options clogging the market, they&#8217;re no longer looking like the value they once were. Many &#8211; like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/sling-tv-revamps-its-service-with-a-price-hike-new-free-tier-a-la-carte-channels/">Sling</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/12/youtube-tv-pricing-goes-up-by-5-month-starting-tomorrow/">YouTube TV</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/02/att-raises-directv-now-pricing-by-5-per-month/">DirecTV Now</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/03/sonys-streaming-tv-service-playstation-vue-raises-its-prices-too/">Vue</a> &#8211; have recently raised their prices, which feels like a flashback to the cable TV era.</p>
<p>And if you factor in their extras &#8211; like expanded storage on &#8220;cloud DVRs&#8221; (a feature that costs very little to providers, compared with the price for the consumer), extra streams, or premium add-ons &#8211; they&#8217;re actually more in line with a cable TV bill than ever before.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if consumers will opt out of live TV streaming, as a result, at some point further down the road. For now, however, the services are growing as more people cut the cord with traditional TV.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.ampproject.org">Accelerated Mobile Pages</a>, or AMP, has <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/19/open_source_insider_google_amp_bad_bad_bad/">been a controversial project since its debut</a>. The need for the framework has been clear: the payloads of mobile pages can be just insane, what with layers and layers of images, Javascript, ad networks, and more slowing down page rendering time and costing users serious bandwidth on metered plans.</p>
<p>Yet, the framework has been aggressively foisted on the community by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which has backed the project <a href="https://twitter.com/cramforce">not just with technical talent</a>, but also by <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search.html">making algorithmic changes to its search results</a> that have essentially mandated that pages comply with the AMP project’s terms — or else lose their ranking on mobile searches.</p>
<p>Even more controversially, as part of making pages faster, the AMP project uses caches of pages on CDNs — which are hosted by Google (<a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/fundamentals/how_cached">and also Cloudflare now</a>). That meant that Google’s search results would direct a user to an AMP page hosted by Google, effectively cutting out the owner of the content in the process.</p>
<p>The project has been led by Malte Ubl, a senior staff engineer working on Google’s Javascript infrastructure projects, who has until now held effective unilateral control over the project.</p>
<p>In the wake of all of this criticism, <a href="https://amphtml.wordpress.com/2018/09/18/governance/">the AMP project announced today</a> that it would reform its governance, replacing Ubl as the exclusive tech lead with a technical steering committee comprised of companies invested in the success in the project. Notably, the project’s intention has an “…end goal of not having any company sit on more than a third of the seats.” In addition, the project will create an advisory board and working groups to shepherd the project’s work.</p>
<p>The project is also expected to move to a foundation in the future. These days, there are a number of places such a project could potentially reside, including the <a href="https://www.apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/">Mozilla Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>While the project has clearly had its detractors, the performance improvements that AMP has been fighting for are certainly meritorious. With this more open governance model, the project may get deeper support from other browser makers like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Mozilla, and Microsoft, as well as the broader open source community.</p>
<p>And while Google has certainly been the major force behind the project, it has also been popular among open source software developers. Since the project’s launch, there have been 710 contributors to the project according to its statistics, and the project (attempting to empathize its non-Google monopoly) notes that more than three quarters of those contributors don’t work at Google.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, more transparency and community involvement should help to accelerate Accelerated Mobile Pages. The project will <a href="https://events.withgoogle.com/amp-contributor-summit/">host its contributor summit</a> next week at Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, where these governance changes as well as the technical and design roadmaps for the project will be top of mind for attendees.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has finished wiring billions of euros to pay back illegal tax benefits to the Irish government <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-apple-taxavoidance/ireland-collects-disputed-apple-taxes-in-full-ahead-of-appeal-idUSKCN1LY1Y5">according to Reuters</a>. Overall, Apple has paid $15.3 billion (€13.1 billion) for the original fine as well as $1.4 billion (€1.2 billion) in interests.</p>
<p>In August 2016 the European Commission ruled that Apple benefited from illegal tax benefits from 2003 to 2014. In particular, the company should have paid more taxes in Ireland — a lot more. Competition Commissioner <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/margrethe-vestager" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="margrethe-vestager">Margrethe Vestager <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said that Apple’s effective corporate tax rate was much lower than expected.</p>
<p>At the time, many global companies used the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/28/the-double-irish-could-be-endangered-preventing-companies-like-google-and-twitter-from-shedding-tax-liabilities/">Double Irish structure</a> to pay corporate tax on a fraction of your actual profit. Apple claimed that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/30/apple-ordered-to-pay-up-to-145-billion-for-illegal-tax-benefits-in-ireland/" title="everything was legal">everything was legal</a>, and the Irish government sided with Apple — probably because the huge fine would be bad for business.</p>
<p>European governments lobbied to put an end to the Double Irish back in 2014. Apple moved some of its international cash to the tiny island of Jersey <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/06/apple-has-reportedly-relocated-its-international-tax-residency-to-jersey/" title="around the same time">around the same time</a>.</p>
<p>For now, the pile of cash is sitting in an escrow account. Apple appealed the European Union’s decision back in 2016. This process could take <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/appeal-over-apple-tax-may-start-this-year-tns55tgtk">up to five years</a>, which means that the Irish government won’t see Apple’s money anytime soon.</p>
<p>If you’ve been following European tax reforms, you know that France, Germany, Spain and Italy were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/france-germany-spain-italy-call-for-turnover-tax-for-tech-giants/" title="a tax reform">discussing</a> a reform to tax big tech companies based on actual revenue in each European country. This way, tech companies wouldn’t be able to report profit in just one country with a lower corporate tax rate.</p>
<p>But it looks like this reform is now stuck as some European countries disagree with this reform. You need everybody on board to pass this kind of reforms. For this reason, it’s unclear if it’s going to happen at all.</p>

The game, usually hosted by comedian Scott Rogowsky (pictured above), spawned a whole cohort of copycats as a result</p>
<p>Its app store ranking, however, has been steadily decreasing in recent months, as pointed out by TechCrunch&#8217;s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/josh-constine" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="josh-constine">Josh Constine <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in a recent article <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/14/hq-trivia-apple-tv/">on HQ Trivia’s Apple TV app launch</a>. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/rus/status/1029475808686100482">response</a> to that article, HQ Trivia co-founder Rus Yusupov hinted at new games in development: &#8220;Games are a hits business and don’t grow exponentially forever. HQ has massive early traction and still millions playing daily. Also developing new game formats, one of which we think is really special and complements Trivia nicely. More soon! Until then thanks for playing.&#8221;</p>
<p>As of January, HQ Trivia was attracting more than 1 million gamers to its live broadcasts. According to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sensor-tower" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sensor-tower">Sensor Tower, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> its app has been downloaded nearly 13 million times.</p>
<p>The company, founded by the entrepreneurs behind Vine, has raised some $24 million to date, garnering a $100 million valuation earlier this year.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire VC <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/peter-thiel" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="peter-thiel">Peter Thiel <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has largely flown under the radar since <a href="https://www.recode.net/2016/7/21/12254284/peter-thiel-rnc-republican-national-convention">raising his hand</a> to support Donald Trump&#8217;s presidential bid, then working with Trump&#8217;s administration to fill some of its many vacant positions. The association made him deeply unpopular in Silicon Valley, though he says people have not shown a &#8220;great deal of hostility to me personally . . . it manifests itself in all sorts of other ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps ahead of the midterm elections, perhaps because he has more recently moved to L.A., or perhaps because he&#8217;s simply feeling more talkative, Thiel is starting to open up again about his often contrarian views to particular outlets. Earlier this year, he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_NhYV63K5E">sat down</a> with Fox Business to discuss his continuing support of Trump. Thiel talked again last week with commentator and comedian Dave Rubin, whose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJdKr0Bgd_5saZYqLCa9mng">YouTube show</a>, Rubin says, is focused on free speech. (The interview format is for people with &#8220;political PTSD,&#8221; suggests its trailer.)</p>
<p>This newest chat, which goes on for more than two hours, touches on a wide number of things, but watching it last night, what we found most striking was Thiel&#8217;s continued disdain for academia despite his own background as both a Stanford undergraduate and law school graduate. Thiel has plainly been successful. He also formed the kind of meaningful, lifelong friendships that one hopes to find at college. Indeed, in a separate, rare public appearance this year, Thiel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2klGJRrjqw">debated Reid Hoffman</a>, a former Stanford classmate and longtime friend of Thiel, at a public policy think tank on Stanford&#8217;s campus.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in his conversation with Rubin, Thiel&#8217;s answer to why Silicon Valley has become so &#8220;left wing&#8221; is higher education. Not instability in the White House or tariffs or immigration or tax cuts or disagreements over foreign policy. Thiel, the free market thinker, thinks schools are to blame for Silicon Valley &#8220;groupthink.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you want to assume for a minute that he is right, then this is a new problem for the region. Thiel volunteered during the interview that Silicon Valley has &#8220;shifted a lot over the years.&#8221; Namely, he said, when he was a college student in the late &#8217;80s, Stanford was &#8220;sort of a very liberal, politically correct place&#8221; but Silicon Valley more broadly &#8220;was not. It was vaguely libertarian,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was a moderate Republican congressional district.&#8221; By the late &#8217;90s, he continued, &#8220;it had sort of shifted to [moderately Democrat] and, fast forward 20 years, it shifted pretty hard left.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investors and founders and employees in Silicon Valley had undergraduate and advanced degrees 20 years ago, as they do now. But that doesn&#8217;t factor into Thiel&#8217;s explanation of Silicon Valley&#8217;s newer leanings. Said Thiel to Rubin of the evolution, &#8220;Part of it is it&#8217;s probably the most educated part of the country, in terms of how much time people spend in college. And I think one of the downsides of too much education is that you get the most brainwashed. And so it is the most educated can also mean that it is the most brainwashed.&#8221;</p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t think the problem extends so much to founders but to the &#8220;rank and file.&#8221; Said Thiel, &#8220;If you&#8217;re a really good engineer or if you&#8217;re really good at a specific thing, your education doesn&#8217;t involve you thinking that much about politics. So it&#8217;s not necessarily from deep ideological conviction; it&#8217;s often more as a fashion statement than as a question of power.&#8221; (Oof.)</p>
<p>Thiel, who is likable in person, has been talking for nearly a decade about the fact that he thinks higher education is overvalued and may actually be a hindrance to innovation. It&#8217;s largely why he created a <a href="https://thielfellowship.org/">fellowship program</a> in 2010 that encourages young people with big ideas to drop out of college and take a shot at realizing their dreams. And his point that more highly educated people are leaning &#8220;left&#8221; is correct. According to data released this spring by the Pew Research Center, &#8220;In 1994, 39 percent of those with a four-year college degree (no postgraduate experience) identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party and 54 percent associated with the Republican Party. In 2017, those figures were exactly reversed.”</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s disappointing to see Thiel embrace anti-intellectualism, because it&#8217;s blatantly divisive (which is maybe his point), because it&#8217;s ridiculous coming from Thiel (who isn&#8217;t exactly part of the proletariat), and because the argument doesn&#8217;t hold up, particularly given that Silicon Valley has long been home to a highly educated workforce, one that used to vote more commonly along Republican lines.</p>
<p>Did college degrees suddenly drive a broader shift in the other direction? No. But moneyed, educated people feigning a <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-08-02/policy-expert-explains-how-anti-intellectualism-gave-rise-donald-trump">reflexive aversion</a> to &#8220;elites&#8221; may have. Americans in Silicon Valley &#8212;  and well beyond  &#8212; are <a href="https://morningconsult.com/tracking-trump/">catching onto the act</a>, too.</p>
<p>If you missed the interview last week, you can catch it right here.</p>

Students get tickets for just $45.</p>
<p>The event’s stage will feature some of the industry’s most groundbreaking companies and thought leaders.</p>
<p>Here are some agenda highlights:</p>
<p><strong>Kickstarting an Industry<br />
</strong><strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/yelena-rachitsky" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yelena Rachitsky</a> [Oculus] </strong><br />
<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oculus-vr" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oculus-vr">Oculus <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into funding VR content. Facebook’s VR future rests on people finding new worlds that they want to step into &#8212; how will Oculus make this happen?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Building Inclusive Worlds</strong><br />
<strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/cyan-banister" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyan Banister</a> [Founders Fund]</strong> (other speakers to be announced soon)<br />
If you had the chance to redesign society, where would you even start? As game developers continue designing massive online virtual worlds where we will spend more and more time, how should we look to correct issues we encounter and how can we build a better future?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The Social Experiment </strong><br />
<strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/adam-arrigo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adam Arrigo</a> [TheWaveVR]</strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/sophia-dominguez-2">Sophia Dominguez</a> [SVRF]</strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/gil-baron-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gil Baron</a> [Mindshow]</strong><br />
If anything, the Oculus VR acquisition in 2014 signaled that Facebook saw VR as a social final frontier. No one really knows what exactly those interactions look like though, but there’s an awful lot that’s already been explored.</p>

<p><strong>Reality Checks</strong><br />
<strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/niko-bonatsos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Niko Bonatsos</a> [General Catalyst]</strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/catherine-ulrich" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Catherine Ulrich</a> [FirstMark Capital]</strong> and<strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jacob-mullins" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Jacob Mullins</a> [Shasta Ventures]</strong><br />
“[VR] is the frothiest space in the Valley right now. Nobody understands it, but everyone wants in. Any idiot could walk into a f***ing room, utter the letters ‘V’ and ‘R’, and VCs would hurl bricks of cash at them.” – Erlich Bachman. While this may have indeed been the case a couple of years ago, investor cash has been a bit sparser in 2018. Where are the opportunities now?</p>

The criminal probe is in addition to the previously reported <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/08/the-sec-wants-tesla-to-explain-elons-420-tweet/">Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the electric car company.</a></p>
<p>“Last month, following Elon’s announcement that he was considering taking the company private, Tesla received a voluntary request for documents from the DOJ and has been cooperative in responding to it,&#8221; a Tesla spokesperson said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. &#8220;We have not received a subpoena, a request for testimony, or any other formal process. We respect the DOJ’s desire to get information about this and believe that the matter should be quickly resolved as they review the information they have received.”</p>
<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-18/tesla-is-said-to-face-u-s-criminal-probe-over-musk-statements">reports</a> that the DOJ&#8217;s criminal inquiry is in the &#8220;early stages&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Justice Department generally does not confirm, deny or otherwise comment on the existence or non-existence of an investigation,&#8221; a spokesperson for the DOJ told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><a href="http://after speaking with shareholders and investigating the process of taking the company private he believes the better path is for Tesla to remain public.">Musk has since retracted those statements</a>, or tweets rather, after speaking with shareholders and investigating the process, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/13/elon-musk-confirms-his-bid-to-take-tesla-private-backed-by-saudi-arabias-sovereign-wealth-fund/">realizing the best path forward</a> for the company was to remain public. Here&#8217;s an excerpt from his Tesla blog post at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Given the feedback I’ve received, it’s apparent that most of Tesla’s existing shareholders believe we are better off as a public company. Additionally, a number of institutional shareholders have explained that they have internal compliance issues that limit how much they can invest in a private company. There is also no proven path for most retail investors to own shares if we were private. Although the majority of shareholders I spoke to said they would remain with Tesla if we went private, the sentiment, in a nutshell, was &#8216;please don’t do this.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>YouTube will no longer maintain a separate app targeting gaming and live game streaming, the company announced today. The YouTube Gaming app, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/26/meet-youtube-gaming-twitchs-archenemy/">first arrived in 2015</a>, will be sunset sometime next spring as its host of features make their way over to YouTube&#8217;s main site.</p>
<p>Over the years, the YouTube Gaming app has been a place where YouTube experimented with features catering to game creators and viewers who like to watch live and recorded esports. Here, it tested things like Game Pages to make games more discoverable, Super Chat, and Channel Memberships &#8211; features which the Amazon-owned game streaming site Twitch had also popularized among the game community.</p>
<p>Some of YouTube Gaming&#8217;s features became so well-received that the company brought them to YouTube. For example, this June <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/youtube-introduces-channel-memberships-merchandise-and-premieres/">YouTube introduced channel memberships</a> to its main site. And before that, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/12/youtube-launches-super-chat-a-way-for-creators-to-make-money-from-their-live-streams/">it had brought Super Chat</a> &#8211; a way for creators to make money from live streams &#8211; to its broader community, as well.</p>
<p>But while gaming remains one of YouTube&#8217;s top verticals, no one was really using the standalone YouTube Gaming app, the company says.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have 200 million people that are logged in, watching gaming content every single day,&#8221; Ryan Wyatt, YouTube&#8217;s Director of Gaming Content and Partnerships, tells TechCrunch. &#8220;And the majority of them, quite frankly, are just not using the YouTube Gaming app for their gaming experiences,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>However, data from Sensor Tower shows the app had over 11 million installs across iOS and Android, and those installs have remained consistent over time. That indicates a large number of people were at least willing to try the app. But the firm also found that its daily users were a &#8220;tiny fraction&#8221; of Twitch&#8217;s on iOS, which confirms Wyatt&#8217;s point about lack of usage.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1714981" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/YT_Gaming.png?w=667" alt="" width="667" height="680" /></p>
<p>Instead, gamers are logging into YouTube to watch gaming, Wyatt explains.</p>
<p>They watch a lot of gaming, too &#8211; over the last twelve months, fans streamed more than 50 billion hours of gaming content, and YouTube has over <a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/livestreaming-q218-report-streamlabs-obs-doubles-tipping-breaks-record-36m-twitch-hits-1m-ef41d2c61923">500,000 quarterly active live gaming streamers</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, YouTube&#8217;s decision to sunset the standalone app should not be seen as an admission that it&#8217;s ceding this space to Twitch &#8211; rather, that it&#8217;s now deciding to use the power of YouTube&#8217;s flagship app to better compete.</p>
<p>On that front, the company is today launching a new YouTube Gaming destination at <a href="http://youtube.com/gaming">youtube.com/gaming</a>. The destination is first available in the U.S., and will roll out globally in the months ahead.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1714961" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/New-YT-Gaming-Destination.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="425" /></p>
<p>A link to the new vertical will appear in the left-side navigation bar, where you find other top-level sections like Trending and Subscriptions.</p>
<p>The Gaming destination will feature personalized content at the top of the page, based on what you like to watch, along with top live games, the latest gaming videos from your subscriptions, and dedicated shelves for live streams and trending videos.</p>
<p>Another feature, &#8220;gaming creator on the rise,&#8221; will highlight up-and-coming gaming creators who are still trying to build an audience. That&#8217;s something that <a href="https://kotaku.com/for-twitch-streamers-who-spend-their-lives-on-camera-i-1792351731">many</a> say is still an issue on Amazon-owned Twitch &#8211; often, their early days <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/16/17569520/twitch-streamers-zero-viewers-motivation-community">are spent streaming to no one</a>. They soon find that they need the blessing of an existing influencer to bring more viewers to their channel.</p>
<p>Wyatt points out, too, that YouTube Gaming won&#8217;t be all about live streams.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other thing that we learned through this process was that the gaming app, and the narrative around it, was very heavily live-focused. Everybody always talked about all the live streaming and live gaming,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But what that did was underserve the vast gaming</p>

<p>business. So by moving it over to YouTube main, you have this beautiful combination of both the living gaming streams that are continuing to grow massively on YouTube, as well as all the other VOD content on the platform.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1714963" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Gaming-Creator-on-the-Rise.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="433" /></p>
<p>There are several things that YouTube&#8217;s new Gaming destination still lacks, however. Most notably, the ability to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/15/youtube-gaming-adds-mobile-streaming-and-twitch-like-features/">live stream gameplay</a> right from your phone.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why the YouTube Gaming app won&#8217;t immediately disappear. Instead, it will stick around until March or maybe even April 2019, while YouTube works on porting the experience over to its main site and app.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re still working through that,&#8221; Wyatt admits, when asked how the live streaming component will come to YouTube proper. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t made a decision on if [live game streaming] will be in there by March, but we do need to have a solution for easy mobile capture from the phone,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The YouTube Gaming app was never a global release, as it was only live in select markets, we should note. YouTube&#8217;s Gaming vertical will eventually be launched worldwide. That could make it more of a challenge to Twitch, as it taps into the eyeballs of <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/youtube-has-1-8-billion-users-logged-in-and-watching-every-month/">YouTube&#8217;s 1.8 billion users</a>, while also expanding to take advantage of other new YouTube features like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/youtube-introduces-channel-memberships-merchandise-and-premieres/">Premieres or Merchandise</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great opportunity to use those features,&#8221; Wyatt notes, regarding the shift from YouTube Gaming to YouTube proper. &#8220;And we&#8217;re going to keep creating more features that will that will really lend themselves to live, but ultimately we&#8217;ll be thinking about really unique ways to apply them to VOD as well,&#8221; he says.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a world where nothing can be trusted and fake news abounds, ICO and crypto teams are further muddying the waters by trying &#8211; and often failing &#8211; to pay for posts. While <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/2563/how-brands-secretly-buy-their-way-into-forbes-fast-company-and-huffpost-stories?zd=1&amp;zi=3ff7hmzc">bribes for blogs</a> is nothing new, sadly the current crop of ICO creators and crypto projects are particularly interested in scaling fast and many ICO CEOs are far happier with scammy multi-level marketing tricks than real media relations.</p>
<p>The worst part of this spammy, scammy ecosystem is the service providers. A new group of media organizations are appearing where pay-to-post is the norm rather than the rare exception. I&#8217;ve been looking at these <a href="https://tokenreporter.substack.com/p/tokenreporter-payola-who-me">groups for a while now</a> and recently found a few egregious examples.</p>
<p>But first some background.</p>
<h1>Oh yeah, Mr. Smart Guy? How do I get press?</h1>
<p>Say you&#8217;re trying to publicize a startup. You&#8217;ve emailed all the big names in the industry and the emails have gone unanswered. Your product is about to flounder on the market without users and you can&#8217;t get any because, in perfect chicken-or-egg fashion, you can&#8217;t get funding without users and you can&#8217;t get users without funding. So isn&#8217;t it a good idea to pay a few dollars for a little press?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And isn&#8217;t most PR just pay-for-post anyway?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>PR people are consummate networkers and are paid to reach out to media on your behalf and their particular set of skills, honed over long careers, are dedicated to breaking down the forcefield between the journalist and the outside world. They are your surrogate hustlers, dedicated to getting you more exposure. A good PR person is worth their weight in gold. They can call up a popular journalist and make a simple pitch: &#8220;This cool new thing is happening. Can I put you in touch?&#8221;</p>
<p>If a journalist&#8217;s mission is to afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted, a good PR person makes the comfortable look slightly afflicted in order to give the journalist a better story. Also, like velociraptors, they are tenacious and will follow up multiple times on your behalf.</p>
<p>A bad PR person, on the other hand, will cold-call hundreds of journalists and read a script that is half the length of Moby Dick. They produce little more than spam and their efforts begin and end with pressing the &#8220;Send&#8221; button. It&#8217;s also interesting to note that many bad PR people, of late, have found new life as ICO specialists.</p>
<p>Now meet the pay-for-post hucksters. As I wrote before, there is now a subset of the PR world that offers to get your press release or story on the top of various websites for the low, low price of between $500 and $13,000. For example, one set of hucksters <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/15/need-a-post-on-harvard-edu-about-your-ico-500-please/">created a small business selling posts on Harvard.edu</a> by creating garbage WordPress blogs and posting press releases to increase SEO coverage. Further, I received a document that outlined the prices for placement in various blogs including this one. While it is impossible to buy a post on TechCrunch this way, it doesn&#8217;t stop many from trying.</p>
<p><img class="align center size-full wp-image-1706290" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image.jpg" alt="" width="699" height="271" /></p>
<p>What&#8217;s the difference between that price list and the job a PR person will do for you? The difference is trust. A pay-for-post huckster is dependent on convincing poorly paid freelance writers to add links and other dross to their posts in order to get a &#8220;placement.&#8221; I get requests like this almost every day and almost all the journalists I talked to reported the same.</p>
<p><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1707763" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-07-at-11.24.45-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="744" /></p>
<p>Some entrepreneurs are savvy enough to avoid these scams. Even more aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never paid since I think it&#8217;s almost always a waste of money but I&#8217;ve been offered this type of coverage many times,&#8221; said Rick Ramos, of <a href="http://HealthJoy.com">HealthJoy.com</a>. &#8220;The last offer was for <a href="https://www.tvwwb.com/">Kathy Ireland&#8217;s Worldwide Business</a>&#8230; A TV show that I&#8217;ve never heard of in my life. I&#8217;ve also been approached by niche publications like <a href=" https://www.insuranceciooutlook.com/">InsuranceOutlook</a> and <a href="https://www.healthcaretechoutlook.com/">HealthCareTechOutlook</a> that want $3,000 for a &#8216;reprint branding package.&#8217; A quick Alexa.com search shows their rank as 1,725,207 and 1,054,501 globally. I think I get pitched at least every six months for one of these types of packages.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of these organizations hide their request for payment until the last minute. That said, how do you know when it&#8217;s someone selling pay-for-play vs. a real editor? It&#8217;s usually obvious.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s usually pretty easy to sniff out based on their email blast. It&#8217;s pretty untargeted with no reference to what your company does or how it related to a story. Some people are up front about the payment but others want a &#8217;15 min call to discuss.&#8217; A quick <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/linkedin" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="linkedin">LinkedIn <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> search always shows them as a sales person versus a reporter or editor,&#8221; said Ramos.</p>
<h1>It&#8217;s getting worse</h1>
<p>This is a document I received from a company attempting an ICO. This sort of menu was quite uncommon until fairly recently when the &#8220;on-demand&#8221; economy melded with PR scammers. The completeness of the document is unique &#8211; you could feasibly plan your own PR efforts just by reaching out to journalists who work at all of these places. But you&#8217;ll also note that each spot has its own price, often in the low hundreds of dollars, which means that those spots are mostly pay-for-play anyway.</p>

<hr />
<p>No PR company can promise coverage. In fact, many pay-for-play folks mention this in their communications, hiding it in plain sight. This snippet of text appeared in a contract for work from one of the pay-for-play providers. In short, you&#8217;re paying for something they cannot guarantee to get. Interestingly, the PR company below calls their product an IO &#8211; an insertion order &#8211; which is language used in ad sales. Further, they take great pains in explaining that it is almost impossible to achieve what they promise.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1706379" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-2.jpg" alt="" width="656" height="185" /></p>
<p>None of the pay-for-post folks I mentioned here would respond to my requests for comment.</p>
<h1>Counter-point: Journalists are also at fault</h1>
<p><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1714886" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-18-at-9.05.00-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="478" /></p>
<p>Journalists should never expect money for coverage.</p>
<p>Yet many do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lately I have worked on a number of blockchain technology pieces and I have encountered a wide variety of these asks,&#8221; said Brittany Whitmore, CEO at <a href="http://www.exvera.com">Exvera Communications</a>. &#8220;A lot of the new, smaller blockchain-focused outlets seem to do a lot of pay-to-play, likely trying to capitalize on the ICO gold rush. The strangest request that I received was that the outlet would do a an article about the news for free but only if we paid them over $1,000 to promote the article with ads. I did not proceed.&#8221;</p>
<p>In one very detailed article on The Outline, Jon Christian explored this world and found that many writers received small sums for a single brand mention in a story, a sort of SEO flogging that rarely helps. He <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/2563/how-brands-secretly-buy-their-way-into-forbes-fast-company-and-huffpost-stories?zd=1&amp;zi=3ff7hmzc">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>An unpaid contributor to the Huffington Post, also speaking on condition of anonymity because, in his words, “I would be pretty fucked if my name got out there,” said that he has included sponsored references to brands in his articles for years, in articles on the Huffington Post and other sites, on behalf of six separate agencies. Some agencies pay him directly, he said, in amounts that can be as small as $50 or $175, but others pay him through an employee’s personal PayPal account in order to obfuscate the source of the funds. In a statement, Huffington Post said “Using the HuffPost Contributors Network to self-publish paid content violates our terms of use. Anyone we discover to be engaging in such abuse has their post removed from the site and is banned from future publication.”<br />
The Huffington Post writer also described specific brands he’d written about on behalf of one of the agencies, which ranged from a popular ride-hailing app, to a publicly-traded site for booking flights and hotels, to a large American cell phone service provider.<br />
“This is a classic example of payola,” he said of the brand mentions, invoking a term that’s been used to describe radio DJs who accept payments from record companies in order to play certain artists on the air.</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, many influencers &#8211; folks who sell their Internet fame to the highest bidder &#8211; masquerade as journalists, asking for outrageous sums to flog an ICO on their YouTube channel or Instagram page. Pay-for-play services can also put out organic content like this in hopes of appearing in the news.</p>
<p><img src="https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/screen-shot-2017-07-28-at-1-21-35-pm.png" /></p>
<p>The rule of thumb? Paid posts and native advertising are not journalism. Ultimately, journalists who charge for coverage are marketers. No one at any reputable news organization will ask for cash but, sadly, there are a number of disreputable news organizations making the rounds.</p>
<h1>ICO spamming/Don&#8217;t do it</h1>
<p><img class="breakout aligncentersize-full wp-image-1707732" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/https-bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-public-images-326fcd8f-923b-4cde-b699-db35a6435b21_940x788.jpeg" alt="" width="940" height="788" /></p>
<p>All this still doesn&#8217;t answer the question: Should you pay-to-post?</p>
<p>&#8220;The short answer is no,&#8221; said Kevin Bourke of <a href="http://bourkepr.com">BourkePR</a>. &#8220;I get asked all the time, and in fact, turned down another request just today. And I advise my clients to decline these offers as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pay-for-post disrupts journalism in a way that should be familiar and desirable to any modern-day entrepreneur. Middlemen are being knocked out everywhere and brands are approaching consumers from every angle including native ads in Instagram and Twitter. But the value of coverage &#8211; real coverage &#8211; from a journalists perspective is the opportunity to explain complex ideas to a ready audience. While posting a picture of a blockchain on Facebook and hoping for clicks is one strategy, explaining your views, opinions, and insights is far more important even if you approach it from a mercenary position.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you start paying for placement, you remove objectivity and credibility, and in my opinion, this is the reason you look for coverage of your company/products in the first place. That&#8217;s what influences readers/viewers. But I understand the temptation for startups. You come to believe that &#8216;all visibility is good visibility.&#8217; I just can&#8217;t agree with that,&#8221; said Bourke. &#8220;I see the trend toward paid placements (now called sponsored content), paid awards and I can&#8217;t stand it &#8211; especially with the trade show awards in high tech. They&#8217;ve completely devalued the Best of Show awards in so many cases. Typically, only the big companies with budgets can afford them, so many of the smaller guys with no money but amazing products get left out. I understand that the publishing industry needs to figure out new revenue streams &#8211; these are very difficult times for them. But they need to figure out smarter business models and maintain the integrity of editorialized content, built on the opinions and perspectives of journalists and influencers.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After its go around my apartment,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/irobots-new-roomba-knows-where-its-going/"> the i7+</a> is “still learning.” It’s fitting sentiment for the new Roomba, which iRobot is positioning as much as a platform as a robotic vacuum. Like a smartphone, it’s designed to learn new tricks over the life of the product, through over the air updates. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this particular case, however, it’s learning the layout of my place. The i7+ builds on the moderately useful dirt mapping rolled out on the 900 series early last year. With a couple of cleans, the new Roomba gets to know the layout of your apartment, building a “Smart Map” in the process. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">iRobot claims such features will have added usefulness as time goes by, including the long-promised ability to serve as a sort of connective tissue for a user’s smart home. For now, however, they serve one key role: teaching the robot to distinguish one room from the next. That means, after a couple of cleans, you’ll be able to designate a bedroom accordingly and tell the Roomba to go clean the bedroom.</span></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/_hIdPLpO5jI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The utility there is pretty straight forward, I think. Before this, cleaning a specific room was a matter of waiting for the vacuum to clean the entire space — or, as I’ve more often done, picked the damn thing up, walked to the room, placed it down and hit Clean. That, of course, doesn’t comport with iRobot’s ultimate goal of keeping the robot out of sight. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even with the new model, I still find myself doing this. Until the Roomba is sophisticated enough to overcome great obstacles like doorway thresholds and can conveniently navigate around my living room without disturbing my rabbit, I’m going to have to continue doing this to some degree. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What’s interesting here though, is that the robot is smart enough to understand when it has been moved to a different room and starts drawing up a new map, accordingly. After one trip around the bedroom and living room (which make up most my apartment) and two goes through my weirdly long entry hallway, it’s at 70 and 95 percent of the maps, respectively.</span></p>
<p><img class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1715116" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG-2927.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="847" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After it’s learned the different rooms, the Roomba continues to update as it goes along. I’ve noticed already some differences between sweeps. Maybe there was something in the way on the floor or the vacuum just didn’t get to it for some reason. In the future, I may rearrange my furniture, and the Roomba will have to adjust accordingly. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is all still early stages for me and the new Roomba, and I do plan to revisit the hardware once we’ve had a bit more time together. In the meantime, I’m pretty impressed with how the device has been refined over the generations. There are little touches here and there, like swapping the mechanical buttons for flush touch ones, making it less sensitive to things like water and dust.</span></p>
<p><img class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1715118" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG-2932.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Roomba says the i7 is quieter than previous generations. It is a bit, though it’s not silent by any stretch — and things get really loud when you add in the Clean base. The process of automatically emptying the bin is short, but man is it loud. Still, there’s a lot to be said for only having to empty it about one-thirtieth of the time. So far, that process works like a charm. When it’s finished, the Roomba simply mounts the base and goes to work. You can also go through the process manually via the app.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Between the improved hardware, mapping and the simple app, which errs of the side of offering almost too much information, it’s hard to complain about the experience the new Roomba affords. Of course, it will cost you.</span></p>
<p><img class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1715121" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG-2934.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The i7 alone is $700. The i7+ with clean base is $950, which I suspect is pushing the boundaries of what people will pay for a robotic vacuum. Granted, iRobot has proven that people are willing to spend for the sort of maintenance a Roomba provides, given that the product is currently the number one vacuum in the U.S. But if the i7 is the iPhone XR, the i7+ is the iPhone XS Max. The advantages are obvious, but you’re going to pay for them. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is getting ready to purposefully influence the U.S. mid-term elections after spending two years trying to safeguard against foreign interference. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="instagram">Instagram <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://instagram-press.com/blog/2018/09/18/helping-our-community-register-to-vote/">plans to run</a> ads in Stories and feed powered by TurboVote that will target all US users over 18 and point them towards information on how to get properly registered and abide by voting rules. Then when election day arrives, users will be able to add an &#8220;I Voted&#8221; sticker to their photos and videos that link to <a href="https://gttp.votinginfoproject.org/">voting info</a> like which polling place to go to.</p>
<p>Combined, these efforts could boost voter turnout, especially amongst Instagram&#8217;s core audience of millennials. If one political party&#8217;s base skews younger, they could receive an advantage. &#8220;Ahead of National Voter Registration Day, we are helping our community register to vote and get to the polls on November 6th&#8221; Instagram writes. &#8220;From today, Instagram will connect US voters with the information they need to get registered.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-1715157 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Facebook-Vote.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="209" /></p>
<p><img class="vertical alignright size-large wp-image-1715167" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IG-TurboVote.png?w=427" alt="" width="427" height="680" />In 2010, a non-partisan &#8220;Get out the vote&#8221; message atop the Facebook News Feed was estimated to have driven 340,000 additional votes. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/us/politics/social-networks-affect-voter-turnout-study-finds.html">The study</a> by Nature suggested that “more of the 0.6% growth in turnout between 2006 and 2010 might have been caused by a single message on Facebook”. That&#8217;s significant considering the 2000 election had a margin of just 0.1 percent of voters.</p>
<p>You can watch Instagram&#8217;s video ads for voting below, which feature a cartoony purple Grimace character and are clearly aimed at a younger audience. They purposefully avoid any Democratic or Republican imagery, but also stick to a polished and American style that could ensure the clips aren&#8217;t mistaken for Russian propaganda.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the company admitted that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/01/instagram-election-interference/">120,000 Instagram posts by the Russian military intelligence group</a> the Internet Research Agency reached 20 million Americans in an attempt to sow discord surrounding the 2016 presidential election. They used a variety of image memes about polarizing social issues to try to divide the country. Facebook has since doubled its security staff to 20,000, required identity verification for political advertisers, and has stepped up its effort to delete scores of fake accounts associated with election interference.</p>
<p>The Russian disinformation attacks could still make users weary to learn about voting from social media. But more turnout means a more democratic society, so it&#8217;s easy to see the positive impact of Instagram efforts here. The question remains whether this voter drive will end up the subject of congressional scrutiny at another inevitable hearing on social media and political bias.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rent-the-runway" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rent-the-runway">Rent the Runway, the <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> fashion startup that began as a rental service for special occasions and has since evolved into a service for people also looking to spice up their everyday wear, just opened up its <a href="https://www.renttherunway.com/stories/stores">fifth physical, standalone location</a>. The new location, in downtown San Francisco, enables Rent the Runway members to try on clothes, rent and return them.</p>
<p>Rent the Runway&#8217;s launch of a standalone brick-and-mortar location in San Francisco comes after it first opened up a location inside Neiman Marcus. With a standalone location, the company is able to offer longer hours for its members. Instead of opening at 10 a.m. and closing at 7 p.m., Rent the Runway can now stay open from 9 a.m. &#8211; 8 p.m. Monday through Friday. It also, of course, has weekend hours.</p>
<p>Thanks to some technology Rent the Runway developed within the last year, it has essentially &#8220;legalized shoplifting&#8221; for its members, Rent the Runway COO Maureen Sullivan told me yesterday ahead of the store&#8217;s launch. Toward the front of the store, there&#8217;s a self-return process that enables anyone to quickly return their items. A little farther back in the store, there&#8217;s a handful of self-checkout kiosks that let members quickly scan their items and leave.</p>
<p><img class="breakout alignnone wp-image-1714999" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/N9A7332.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p>Since its launch about nine years ago, Rent the Runway has launched two additional product offerings. In addition to its standard Reserve product, a one-time rental, Rent the Runway now offers two subscription products. The first is called Unlimited, which lets members rent four items at a time on a constant rotation (meaning you can swap them out as much as you want) for $159 a month.</p>
<p>The second is called Update, which lets you rent just four items for the whole month for $89 per month. In the event someone really likes what they&#8217;ve rented, they always have the option to purchase the item at anywhere from 10 percent to 75 percent off. Today, the subscription products make up 50 percent of Rent the Runway&#8217;s revenue, with San Francisco as the third largest subscription market.</p>
<p><img class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1715004" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/N9A7555-e1537280737402.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="771" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the nine years or so Rent the Runway has been around, a number of other services have cropped up around fashion. Stitch Fix, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/17/stitch-fix-up-just-1-on-first-day-of-trading-after-reducing-size-of-ipo/">which went public last November</a>, and Trunk Club by Nordstrom are two of the big ones. But what differentiates Rent the Runway from the likes of Stitch Fix is that, &#8220;they&#8217;re trying to get you to buy stuff,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;You&#8217;re still buying things that accumulate in your closet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The vision with Rent the runway is to get to the point where 50 percent of your closet is rented, and therefore less cluttered. Rent the Runway, for example, has some customers who wear rented clothes 120 days out of the year.</p>
<p>Rent the Runway currently partners with over 500 brands, and operates as a new type of distribution channel for them. What Rent the Runway offers for brands is marketing and discovery, and customer data.</p>
<p>Down the road, Rent the Runway does envision getting into men&#8217;s clothing Sullivan said, but right now, there&#8217;s &#8220;unprecedented growth&#8221; in women&#8217;s clothing, so that&#8217;s where the focus will be for now.</p>
<p>Back in August, Rent the Runway partnered with Temasek for a $200 million credit facility. Before that deal, Rent the Runway had raised more than $200 million from traditional investors like KPCBC, Highland Capital, Bain Capital, TCV and others.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Assassin’s Creed Odyssey Echo Plus is a limited edition, which will no doubt make fans want the thing that much more. It’s a standard Amazon device that Ubisoft dressed up in a Spartan helmet, to be given away in small quantities through the company’s site. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ridiculous thing is the game maker’s way of promoting a new Alexa skill, designed to provide useful tips for the upcoming action role-playing title. The download will be available for all Echo devices (Greek battle helmet or no) starting October 2 — three days before Assassin’s Creed Odyssey officially hits consoles.</span></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rjCqK38Co4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are 1,500 responses available through the skill, which describe points of interest, offer up contextual information and just generally help you through the game. There also are some fittingly goofy ones designed to parrot common Alexa questions like,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">“What’s the temperature today?”</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1"> “It’s colder than the heart of Hades after a bad breakup.”</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">“What’s on my shopping list?” </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">“Blood-stain remover. That is all.”</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and also</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">“Tell me a joke.” </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">“An Athenian declared war. HAH! Get it?”</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They say comedy’s all in the timing, and that one’s about 2,500 years late. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.spire.io/">Spire&#8217;s Health Tags</a>, the dark and tiny devices you stick on your clothes to gather all sorts of health data from your steps, heartbeat and stress levels is now available at your local Apple Store.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/17/spire-breath-taker/">started out</a> with a breath tracking device to detect when you are feeling tense and help calm you down. But four years in and its now all about the wearable &#8220;tags&#8221; you stick on items of clothing like your pants or sports bra.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, there are lots of gadgets out there to gather similar information &#8212; the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Watch will now even detect if you have a fall or if something is wrong with your heart &#8212; but the Spire health tag is nothing like a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fitbit" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fitbit">Fitbit <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> or Apple Watch, according to the company. For one, there&#8217;s zero need to charge the device. One tag&#8217;s battery will last a year and a half before dying out. They&#8217;re also machine washable. You just pick a few outfits and stick a tag on each of them.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1714667" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/HealthTag_Held-Close-e1537245186333.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="331" /></p>
<p>Of course a few other startups out there are working on making smart, washable, data-gathering clothes. <a href="https://www.getenflux.com/">Enflux</a> makes the clothing and then sews in the motion sensor to tell you if you are lifting correctly. <a href="https://vitaliwear.com/">Vitali</a> is a &#8220;smart&#8221; bra with a built-in sensor to detect stress. Then there&#8217;s <a href="https://www.omsignal.com/">OmSignal</a>, which makes body-hugging workout clothes that gather &#8220;medical-grade biometric data to achieve optimal health.&#8221; But these tiny health tags are different in that they allow you to choose the clothes you want to adhere the monitor to.</p>
<p>Like Spire&#8217;s first product, the Stone, which earned more than $8 million in sales, according to the company, the tags will also pick up on times of stress and help calm you down through a series of breaths and focus on the app.</p>
<p>&#8220;Continuous health data will revolutionize health and wellness globally, but early incarnations have been hampered by poor user experiences and a focus on the hardware over the outcomes that the hardware can create,” Spire&#8217;s founder Jonathan Palley said. &#8220;By making the device ‘disappear’, we believe Health Tag is the first product to unlock the potential.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spire&#8217;s Health Tags will be sold in Apple Stores as a three-pack for $130, six-pack for $230 and an eight-pack for $300, with additional pack sizes available on the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.spire.io/">website</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#8217;s focus on using its camera-enabled Echo devices to help you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/07/echo-look-to-dole-out-fashion-advice-from-vogue-and-gq/">figure out what to wear everyday</a> has highlighted how the tech world sees a big opportunity in building fashion-related tools and services beyond the now-ubiquitous but still quite basic business of e-commerce, where clothes are displayed on websites, and ordered for delivery to your home. Now one of the latest startups in the space has raised a seed round from an interesting group of investors.</p>
<p>Maison Me, a startup that has built a platform that lets people provide either a few clues, or very specific detail, of a piece of clothing that they would like, and then makes it to order, has raised $1 million to build out its business from backers that include Founders Fund, the new <a href="https://developers.google.com/actions/assistant-investments">Google Assistant investment program</a>, Gagarin Capital and others that are not being named for now. Maison Me&#8217;s co-founder and CEO Anastasia Sartan said that the startup will be using the money to continue optimising its services and building for new platforms such as Google Home.</p>
<p>That particular device is a notable one to build for: currently Google doesn&#8217;t have a camera or screen, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/17/google-said-to-be-releasing-its-own-smart-display-this-year/">many reports speculate</a> that it will be launching a new version very soon that will. Meanwhile, Amazon is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/17/amazon-taps-getty-to-provide-images-for-visual-searches-on-the-echo-show-and-echo-spot/">level-pegging</a> on me-too functionality.</p>
<p>Google of course is not saying anything about any upcoming hardware, and sees Maison Me as something useful for the Google Home speaker that we know today, and for the displays out there not made by Google that are being powered by it.</p>
<p>“A lot of people start their daily routines asking their Google Home speakers for a weather forecast, looking for some help before they pick out their outfits for the day,&#8221; said ​Ilya Gelfenbeyn, head of the Google Assistant investment program, in a statement. &#8220;Smart Displays with the Google Assistant make it possible to build services and recommendations in such a visual industry like fashion, and we believe that personalized what-to-wear recommendations can really simplify the morning routines for people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maison Me will have its first Google app of its clothing service ready in the beginning of November. But Maison Me (and Epytom, which is the name of the actual startup) has been in business for a while already, starting first with a chatbot that helped people figure out what to wear &#8212; data, Sartan said, has been used to help feed its algorithms for its clothing-making service. That bot is still active and has racked up 300,000 users so far.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google is emphasizing routines in voice assistants,&#8221; Sartan explained. &#8220;In the morning, 78 percent of people ask about the weather. But why? It is to figure out what to wear. Knowing the location and preferences and we can help here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pitch that Maison Me is making for the clothing service is that it can go from specs to delivery in 15 days &#8212; longer than a Prime-style turnaround of a day, or nipping out to the shops for a quick purchase, but potentially more rewarding and individualised. The garments, she said, are all made in the US.</p>
<p>Within those two weeks there are a number of stages: After a conversation about the garment-to-come, which includes questions about a buyer&#8217;s interests beyond fashion, the data goes through algorithms created by Maison Me and then handed off to a human (not robot!) designer. A custom sketch is made for approval or modifications. All of that costs $15.</p>
<p>Then comes the making of the garment. A professional tailor &#8212; again, not a bot or computer vision program &#8212; takes a customer&#8217;s measurements and starts to produce the clothes, which end up with the user within 15 days.</p>
<div title="Page 2">
<p>One of the big issues that Sartan says she was trying to tackle is &#8220;dead stock&#8221; &#8212; the massive amount of overproduction that fashion houses and retailers create in the process of making mass-produced clothes. The creation and &#8220;disposal&#8221; of dead stock &#8212; in order for a brand to continue to have cachet &#8212; has been the subject of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliviapinnock/2018/07/20/no-one-in-fashion-is-surprised-burberry-burnt-28-million-of-stock/">some controversy</a> in the fashion industry, since not only does it fundamentally feel wasteful, but there is an environmental impact as well.</p>
<p>“Dead stock is the burden of the global fashion industry and the environment, and so are the unmet customers’ expectations regarding the fit, quality, and cost. Our goal now is to create clothes you reach for the most, because they fit your body and life perfectly, go with the rest of your wardrobe, and are truly worth their price,&#8221; Sartan said.</p>
