            <Description>The news that Nintendo would be adding NES games to the Switch as part of its paid online service had a mixed reception, but the company has completely made up for this controversial decision by releasing wireless NES controllers with which to play those games.

            <Description>Watching the current price madness is scary. Bitcoin is falling and rising in $500 increments with regularity and Ethereum and its attendant ICOs are in a seeming freefall with a few &amp;#8220;dead cat bounces&amp;#8221; to keep things lively.

            <Description>The incredible agility of the common house or fruit fly puts every drone and robot to shame, but devices inspired by them are beginning to catch up. A new four-winged flapping robot not only successfully imitates the fruit fly&apos;s hyper-agile flying method, but can travel for up to a kilometer before running out of juice.</Description>
